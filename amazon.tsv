amazon	Mick	2010-11-04T13:38:52Z	"Two options: 1) Average prices, lousy service and China slow delivery. 2) Average prices, lousy service, expensive shipping membership, same shipping time that other retailers offer for free.Amazon non-Prime customers receive a lower standard of customer service. Also, Amazon intentionally inconveniences Non-Prime customers by delaying shipping for an unreasonable amount of time in an attempt to manipulate shoppers into buying Prime.Product prices are initially adjusted up to cover shipping, and then they want you to buy Prime in order to receive it in a reasonable amount of time. Prime two day delivery is nothing special, it's not offered on all products and often unreliable. I receive eBay and Walmart orders before Amazon. I placed three separate orders over a period of three days, only one showed ""shipped"" four days after placing the last order. It was the last order I placed that showed and It only shipped because I had attempted to cancel that order. The status just happened to change at the exact time I tried to cancel, so that I couldn't cancel. And, it sat in the warehouse for days after that.  Amazon may be a fair deal for customers who find enough value in the other services offered with Prime membership and shop enough to justify purchasing it. However, it is not a fair marketplace for the infrequent shopping non-Prime customer.Amazon no longer passes along savings to customers. Aside from initial pocketing, the company uses it's profits for huge advertising and massive expansion."	N/A, US	1 review	2
amazon	Luther Tan	2010-11-03T12:15:51Z	I believe giving them 3 stars is a fair rating. My experiences with Amazon is similar to a love hate relationship. At times, the items I ordered gets delivered on time and in perfect condition which I am very grateful of. But other times, my items are either slightly damaged or late. I had to return them and it will take ages for the item to be sent back before a replacement arrives. Dilemma indeed!	N/A, MY	6 reviews	3

amazon	Eelasor, Idaho	2010-09-01T19:23:37Z	My experience with making purchases from Amazon has usually been a positive one.  However, in the event that a product I purchase is incorrect and the fault is from a third party seller, Amazon has often provided a refund or told me to keep the item.  There have also been times when experiencing certain issues regarding an item to be purchased, and  they have offered courtesy services such as free shipping or percentages off an item when applicable.For the most part, if someone search for good pricing deals they will find it here, especially for good used books and other good used products as well.

amazon	anthony genth	2010-07-14T11:19:41Z	"Amazon is too big and completely out of control! I placed an order with Amazon while traveling on business in the UK. When I went to Amazon all of my personal information including my credit cards were stored on the Amazon.co.uk site. When I tried to get a refund for the order that was not delivered they told me i have to call the UK as the companies are separate? When I asked them if the companies are separate how come the UK Amazon has all of my personal information? They told me that they share information with all Amazon companies but if there is a problem with an order then the client has to call Amazon in the country where the order was placed?!? I wonder what the GDPR authorities have to say about such a casual attitude to the GDPR privacy protection law? I also live in a an apartment with another family and although we have separate Amazon accounts and Prime accounts, Amazon regularly mixes up our orders and cross utilizes our credit cards?? I don't think that this is legal and when i complain to them it's ""well it's our policy""??? Terrible arrogant company."	N/A, US	4 reviews	1

amazon	dogtown23	2010-04-17T21:53:20Z	I have happily cut Amazon out of my life entirely.  I do not purchase anything for my business or home from them due to their  awful customer service when I was a paying Prime customer.  The csr's I have spoken to were not helpful and did not attempt to solve the two problems I have ever had to call about.   Both times I have called were about Amazon sold and fulfilled products that were faulty or defective and cost less than $20 each.   They only would say it was my problem and that I should get in touch with the manufacturer and that Amazon would do nothing and would not provide any assistance in getting product replaced.

amazon	Leo Terrell	2010-04-10T02:14:53Z	Everyone goes to the store to search for what they want and when it comes to online shopping it is very convenient. Amazon is a very well-known and great place to go online and shop for certain products. Although, Amazon is literally taking over the world and making businesses and companies out of business it is still the best online shopping place, because service can be extremely fast, there are lots of discounts on products, and the products are just very useful.My family has amazon prime and we can buy products and get them in two days. You even get discounts too, there was a product that my parents were gonna buy for $60, but with amazon prime the price went down to $20. Can you believe it? Although, many businesses and companies are going out of business, Amazon has everything you need at a good price and good shipping. Amazon is a very great place to shop and their products are always in good condition,  hopefully they never run out of business.	N/A, US	1 review	5

amazon	Eelasor, Idaho	2010-09-01T19:23:37Z	My experience with making purchases from Amazon has usually been a positive one.  However, in the event that a product I purchase is incorrect and the fault is from a third party seller, Amazon has often provided a refund or told me to keep the item.  There have also been times when experiencing certain issues regarding an item to be purchased, and  they have offered courtesy services such as free shipping or percentages off an item when applicable.For the most part, if someone search for good pricing deals they will find it here, especially for good used books and other good used products as well.

amazon	anthony genth	2010-07-14T11:19:41Z	"Amazon is too big and completely out of control! I placed an order with Amazon while traveling on business in the UK. When I went to Amazon all of my personal information including my credit cards were stored on the Amazon.co.uk site. When I tried to get a refund for the order that was not delivered they told me i have to call the UK as the companies are separate? When I asked them if the companies are separate how come the UK Amazon has all of my personal information? They told me that they share information with all Amazon companies but if there is a problem with an order then the client has to call Amazon in the country where the order was placed?!? I wonder what the GDPR authorities have to say about such a casual attitude to the GDPR privacy protection law? I also live in a an apartment with another family and although we have separate Amazon accounts and Prime accounts, Amazon regularly mixes up our orders and cross utilizes our credit cards?? I don't think that this is legal and when i complain to them it's ""well it's our policy""??? Terrible arrogant company."	N/A, US	4 reviews	1

amazon	dogtown23	2010-04-17T21:53:20Z	I have happily cut Amazon out of my life entirely.  I do not purchase anything for my business or home from them due to their  awful customer service when I was a paying Prime customer.  The csr's I have spoken to were not helpful and did not attempt to solve the two problems I have ever had to call about.   Both times I have called were about Amazon sold and fulfilled products that were faulty or defective and cost less than $20 each.   They only would say it was my problem and that I should get in touch with the manufacturer and that Amazon would do nothing and would not provide any assistance in getting product replaced.

amazon	Leo Terrell	2010-04-10T02:14:53Z	Everyone goes to the store to search for what they want and when it comes to online shopping it is very convenient. Amazon is a very well-known and great place to go online and shop for certain products. Although, Amazon is literally taking over the world and making businesses and companies out of business it is still the best online shopping place, because service can be extremely fast, there are lots of discounts on products, and the products are just very useful.My family has amazon prime and we can buy products and get them in two days. You even get discounts too, there was a product that my parents were gonna buy for $60, but with amazon prime the price went down to $20. Can you believe it? Although, many businesses and companies are going out of business, Amazon has everything you need at a good price and good shipping. Amazon is a very great place to shop and their products are always in good condition,  hopefully they never run out of business.	N/A, US	1 review	5

Also, Amazon intentionally inconveniences Non-Prime customers by delaying shipping for an unreasonable amount of time in an attempt to manipulate shoppers into buying Prime.Product prices are initially adjusted up to cover shipping, and then they want you to buy Prime in order to receive it in a reasonable amount of time. Prime two day delivery is nothing special, it's not offered on all products and often unreliable. I receive eBay and Walmart orders before Amazon. I placed three separate orders over a period of three days, only one showed ""shipped"" four days after placing the last order. It was the last order I placed that showed and It only shipped because I had attempted to cancel that order. The status just happened to change at the exact time I tried to cancel, so that I couldn't cancel. And, it sat in the warehouse for days after that.  Amazon may be a fair deal for customers who find enough value in the other services offered with Prime membership and shop enough to justify purchasing it. However, it is not a fair marketplace for the infrequent shopping non-Prime customer.Amazon no longer passes along savings to customers. Aside from initial pocketing, the company uses it's profits for huge advertising and massive expansion."	N/A, US	1 review	2

There have also been times when experiencing certain issues regarding an item to be purchased, and  they have offered courtesy services such as free shipping or percentages off an item when applicable.For the most part, if someone search for good pricing deals they will find it here, especially for good used books and other good used products as well.

amazon	anthony genth	2010-07-14T11:19:41Z	"Amazon is too big and completely out of control! I placed an order with Amazon while traveling on business in the UK. When I went to Amazon all of my personal information including my credit cards were stored on the Amazon.co.uk site. When I tried to get a refund for the order that was not delivered they told me i have to call the UK as the companies are separate? When I asked them if the companies are separate how come the UK Amazon has all of my personal information? They told me that they share information with all Amazon companies but if there is a problem with an order then the client has to call Amazon in the country where the order was placed?!? I wonder what the GDPR authorities have to say about such a casual attitude to the GDPR privacy protection law? I also live in a an apartment with another family and although we have separate Amazon accounts and Prime accounts, Amazon regularly mixes up our orders and cross utilizes our credit cards?? I don't think that this is legal and when i complain to them it's ""well it's our policy""??? Terrible arrogant company."	N/A, US	4 reviews	1

amazon	dogtown23	2010-04-17T21:53:20Z	I have happily cut Amazon out of my life entirely.  I do not purchase anything for my business or home from them due to their  awful customer service when I was a paying Prime customer.  The csr's I have spoken to were not helpful and did not attempt to solve the two problems I have ever had to call about.   Both times I have called were about Amazon sold and fulfilled products that were faulty or defective and cost less than $20 each.   They only would say it was my problem and that I should get in touch with the manufacturer and that Amazon would do nothing and would not provide any assistance in getting product replaced.

amazon	Leo Terrell	2010-04-10T02:14:53Z	Everyone goes to the store to search for what they want and when it comes to online shopping it is very convenient. Amazon is a very well-known and great place to go online and shop for certain products. Although, Amazon is literally taking over the world and making businesses and companies out of business it is still the best online shopping place, because service can be extremely fast, there are lots of discounts on products, and the products are just very useful.My family has amazon prime and we can buy products and get them in two days. You even get discounts too, there was a product that my parents were gonna buy for $60, but with amazon prime the price went down to $20. Can you believe it? Although, many businesses and companies are going out of business, Amazon has everything you need at a good price and good shipping. Amazon is a very great place to shop and their products are always in good condition,  hopefully they never run out of business.	N/A, US	1 review	5

amazon	Mick	2010-11-04T13:38:52Z	"Two options: 1) Average prices, lousy service and China slow delivery. 2) Average prices, lousy service, expensive shipping membership, same shipping time that other retailers offer for free.Amazon non-Prime customers receive a lower standard of customer service. Also, Amazon intentionally inconveniences Non-Prime customers by delaying shipping for an unreasonable amount of time in an attempt to manipulate shoppers into buying Prime.Product prices are initially adjusted up to cover shipping, and then they want you to buy Prime in order to receive it in a reasonable amount of time. Prime two day delivery is nothing special, it's not offered on all products and often unreliable. I receive eBay and Walmart orders before Amazon. I placed three separate orders over a period of three days, only one showed ""shipped"" four days after placing the last order. It was the last order I placed that showed and It only shipped because I had attempted to cancel that order. The status just happened to change at the exact time I tried to cancel, so that I couldn't cancel. And, it sat in the warehouse for days after that.  Amazon may be a fair deal for customers who find enough value in the other services offered with Prime membership and shop enough to justify purchasing it. However, it is not a fair marketplace for the infrequent shopping non-Prime customer.Amazon no longer passes along savings to customers. Aside from initial pocketing, the company uses it's profits for huge advertising and massive expansion."	N/A, US	1 review	2

amazon	Leo Terrell	2010-04-10T02:14:53Z	Everyone goes to the store to search for what they want and when it comes to online shopping it is very convenient. Amazon is a very well-known and great place to go online and shop for certain products. Although, Amazon is literally taking over the world and making businesses and companies out of business it is still the best online shopping place, because service can be extremely fast, there are lots of discounts on products, and the products are just very useful.My family has amazon prime and we can buy products and get them in two days. You even get discounts too, there was a product that my parents were gonna buy for $60, but with amazon prime the price went down to $20. Can you believe it? Although, many businesses and companies are going out of business, Amazon has everything you need at a good price and good shipping. Amazon is a very great place to shop and their products are always in good condition,  hopefully they never run out of business.	N/A, US	1 review	5

Also, Amazon intentionally inconveniences Non-Prime customers by delaying shipping for an unreasonable amount of time in an attempt to manipulate shoppers into buying Prime.Product prices are initially adjusted up to cover shipping, and then they want you to buy Prime in order to receive it in a reasonable amount of time. Prime two day delivery is nothing special, it's not offered on all products and often unreliable. I receive eBay and Walmart orders before Amazon. I placed three separate orders over a period of three days, only one showed ""shipped"" four days after placing the last order. It was the last order I placed that showed and It only shipped because I had attempted to cancel that order. The status just happened to change at the exact time I tried to cancel, so that I couldn't cancel. And, it sat in the warehouse for days after that.  Amazon may be a fair deal for customers who find enough value in the other services offered with Prime membership and shop enough to justify purchasing it. However, it is not a fair marketplace for the infrequent shopping non-Prime customer.Amazon no longer passes along savings to customers. Aside from initial pocketing, the company uses it's profits for huge advertising and massive expansion."	N/A, US	1 review	2

At times, the items I ordered gets delivered on time and in perfect condition which I am very grateful of. But other times, my items are either slightly damaged or late.

amazon	Eelasor, Idaho	2010-09-01T19:23:37Z	My experience with making purchases from Amazon has usually been a positive one.  However, in the event that a product I purchase is incorrect and the fault is from a third party seller, Amazon has often provided a refund or told me to keep the item.  There have also been times when experiencing certain issues regarding an item to be purchased, and  they have offered courtesy services such as free shipping or percentages off an item when applicable.For the most part, if someone search for good pricing deals they will find it here, especially for good used books and other good used products as well.

When I went to Amazon all of my personal information including my credit cards were stored on the Amazon.co.uk site.

When I asked them if the companies are separate how come the UK Amazon has all of my personal information? They told me that they share information with all Amazon companies but if there is a problem with an order then the client has to call Amazon in the country where the order was placed?!?

I also live in a an apartment with another family and although we have separate Amazon accounts and Prime accounts, Amazon regularly mixes up our orders and cross utilizes our credit cards??

amazon	Luther Tan	2010-11-03T12:15:51Z	I believe giving them 3 stars is a fair rating. My experiences with Amazon is similar to a love hate relationship. At times, the items I ordered gets delivered on time and in perfect condition which I am very grateful of. But other times, my items are either slightly damaged or late. I had to return them and it will take ages for the item to be sent back before a replacement arrives. Dilemma indeed!	N/A, MY	6 reviews	3

amazon	Eelasor, Idaho	2010-09-01T19:23:37Z	My experience with making purchases from Amazon has usually been a positive one.  However, in the event that a product I purchase is incorrect and the fault is from a third party seller, Amazon has often provided a refund or told me to keep the item.  There have also been times when experiencing certain issues regarding an item to be purchased, and  they have offered courtesy services such as free shipping or percentages off an item when applicable.For the most part, if someone search for good pricing deals they will find it here, especially for good used books and other good used products as well.

When I went to Amazon all of my personal information including my credit cards were stored on the Amazon.co.uk site. When I tried to get a refund for the order that was not delivered they told me i have to call the UK as the companies are separate? When I asked them if the companies are separate how come the UK Amazon has all of my personal information? They told me that they share information with all Amazon companies but if there is a problem with an order then the client has to call Amazon in the country where the order was placed?!? I wonder what the GDPR authorities have to say about such a casual attitude to the GDPR privacy protection law? I also live in a an apartment with another family and although we have separate Amazon accounts and Prime accounts, Amazon regularly mixes up our orders and cross utilizes our credit cards?? I don't think that this is legal and when i complain to them it's ""well it's our policy""??? Terrible arrogant company."	N/A, US	4 reviews	1

amazon	dogtown23	2010-04-17T21:53:20Z	I have happily cut Amazon out of my life entirely.  I do not purchase anything for my business or home from them due to their  awful customer service when I was a paying Prime customer.  The csr's I have spoken to were not helpful and did not attempt to solve the two problems I have ever had to call about.   Both times I have called were about Amazon sold and fulfilled products that were faulty or defective and cost less than $20 each.   They only would say it was my problem and that I should get in touch with the manufacturer and that Amazon would do nothing and would not provide any assistance in getting product replaced.

amazon	Leo Terrell	2010-04-10T02:14:53Z	Everyone goes to the store to search for what they want and when it comes to online shopping it is very convenient. Amazon is a very well-known and great place to go online and shop for certain products. Although, Amazon is literally taking over the world and making businesses and companies out of business it is still the best online shopping place, because service can be extremely fast, there are lots of discounts on products, and the products are just very useful.My family has amazon prime and we can buy products and get them in two days. You even get discounts too, there was a product that my parents were gonna buy for $60, but with amazon prime the price went down to $20. Can you believe it? Although, many businesses and companies are going out of business, Amazon has everything you need at a good price and good shipping. Amazon is a very great place to shop and their products are always in good condition,  hopefully they never run out of business.	N/A, US	1 review	5

amazon	Eelasor, Idaho	2010-09-01T19:23:37Z	My experience with making purchases from Amazon has usually been a positive one.  However, in the event that a product I purchase is incorrect and the fault is from a third party seller, Amazon has often provided a refund or told me to keep the item.  There have also been times when experiencing certain issues regarding an item to be purchased, and  they have offered courtesy services such as free shipping or percentages off an item when applicable.For the most part, if someone search for good pricing deals they will find it here, especially for good used books and other good used products as well.

amazon	anthony genth	2010-07-14T11:19:41Z	"Amazon is too big and completely out of control! I placed an order with Amazon while traveling on business in the UK. When I went to Amazon all of my personal information including my credit cards were stored on the Amazon.co.uk site. When I tried to get a refund for the order that was not delivered they told me i have to call the UK as the companies are separate? When I asked them if the companies are separate how come the UK Amazon has all of my personal information? They told me that they share information with all Amazon companies but if there is a problem with an order then the client has to call Amazon in the country where the order was placed?!? I wonder what the GDPR authorities have to say about such a casual attitude to the GDPR privacy protection law? I also live in a an apartment with another family and although we have separate Amazon accounts and Prime accounts, Amazon regularly mixes up our orders and cross utilizes our credit cards?? I don't think that this is legal and when i complain to them it's ""well it's our policy""??? Terrible arrogant company."	N/A, US	4 reviews	1

amazon	dogtown23	2010-04-17T21:53:20Z	I have happily cut Amazon out of my life entirely.  I do not purchase anything for my business or home from them due to their  awful customer service when I was a paying Prime customer.  The csr's I have spoken to were not helpful and did not attempt to solve the two problems I have ever had to call about.   Both times I have called were about Amazon sold and fulfilled products that were faulty or defective and cost less than $20 each.   They only would say it was my problem and that I should get in touch with the manufacturer and that Amazon would do nothing and would not provide any assistance in getting product replaced.

amazon	Leo Terrell	2010-04-10T02:14:53Z	Everyone goes to the store to search for what they want and when it comes to online shopping it is very convenient. Amazon is a very well-known and great place to go online and shop for certain products. Although, Amazon is literally taking over the world and making businesses and companies out of business it is still the best online shopping place, because service can be extremely fast, there are lots of discounts on products, and the products are just very useful.My family has amazon prime and we can buy products and get them in two days. You even get discounts too, there was a product that my parents were gonna buy for $60, but with amazon prime the price went down to $20. Can you believe it? Although, many businesses and companies are going out of business, Amazon has everything you need at a good price and good shipping. Amazon is a very great place to shop and their products are always in good condition,  hopefully they never run out of business.	N/A, US	1 review	5

amazon	Mick	2010-11-04T13:38:52Z	"Two options: 1) Average prices, lousy service and China slow delivery. 2) Average prices, lousy service, expensive shipping membership, same shipping time that other retailers offer for free.Amazon non-Prime customers receive a lower standard of customer service. Also, Amazon intentionally inconveniences Non-Prime customers by delaying shipping for an unreasonable amount of time in an attempt to manipulate shoppers into buying Prime.Product prices are initially adjusted up to cover shipping, and then they want you to buy Prime in order to receive it in a reasonable amount of time. Prime two day delivery is nothing special, it's not offered on all products and often unreliable. I receive eBay and Walmart orders before Amazon. I placed three separate orders over a period of three days, only one showed ""shipped"" four days after placing the last order. It was the last order I placed that showed and It only shipped because I had attempted to cancel that order. The status just happened to change at the exact time I tried to cancel, so that I couldn't cancel. And, it sat in the warehouse for days after that.  Amazon may be a fair deal for customers who find enough value in the other services offered with Prime membership and shop enough to justify purchasing it. However, it is not a fair marketplace for the infrequent shopping non-Prime customer.Amazon no longer passes along savings to customers. Aside from initial pocketing, the company uses it's profits for huge advertising and massive expansion."	N/A, US	1 review	2

amazon	dogtown23	2010-04-17T21:53:20Z	I have happily cut Amazon out of my life entirely.  I do not purchase anything for my business or home from them due to their  awful customer service when I was a paying Prime customer.  The csr's I have spoken to were not helpful and did not attempt to solve the two problems I have ever had to call about.   Both times I have called were about Amazon sold and fulfilled products that were faulty or defective and cost less than $20 each.   They only would say it was my problem and that I should get in touch with the manufacturer and that Amazon would do nothing and would not provide any assistance in getting product replaced.

amazon	Leo Terrell	2010-04-10T02:14:53Z	Everyone goes to the store to search for what they want and when it comes to online shopping it is very convenient. Amazon is a very well-known and great place to go online and shop for certain products. Although, Amazon is literally taking over the world and making businesses and companies out of business it is still the best online shopping place, because service can be extremely fast, there are lots of discounts on products, and the products are just very useful.My family has amazon prime and we can buy products and get them in two days. You even get discounts too, there was a product that my parents were gonna buy for $60, but with amazon prime the price went down to $20. Can you believe it? Although, many businesses and companies are going out of business, Amazon has everything you need at a good price and good shipping. Amazon is a very great place to shop and their products are always in good condition,  hopefully they never run out of business.	N/A, US	1 review	5

Also, Amazon intentionally inconveniences Non-Prime customers by delaying shipping for an unreasonable amount of time in an attempt to manipulate shoppers into buying Prime.Product prices are initially adjusted up to cover shipping, and then they want you to buy Prime in order to receive it in a reasonable amount of time. Prime two day delivery is nothing special, it's not offered on all products and often unreliable. I receive eBay and Walmart orders before Amazon. I placed three separate orders over a period of three days, only one showed ""shipped"" four days after placing the last order. It was the last order I placed that showed and It only shipped because I had attempted to cancel that order. The status just happened to change at the exact time I tried to cancel, so that I couldn't cancel. And, it sat in the warehouse for days after that.  Amazon may be a fair deal for customers who find enough value in the other services offered with Prime membership and shop enough to justify purchasing it. However, it is not a fair marketplace for the infrequent shopping non-Prime customer.Amazon no longer passes along savings to customers. Aside from initial pocketing, the company uses it's profits for huge advertising and massive expansion."	N/A, US	1 review	2
amazon	Luther Tan	2010-11-03T12:15:51Z	I believe giving them 3 stars is a fair rating. My experiences with Amazon is similar to a love hate relationship. At times, the items I ordered gets delivered on time and in perfect condition which I am very grateful of. But other times, my items are either slightly damaged or late. I had to return them and it will take ages for the item to be sent back before a replacement arrives. Dilemma indeed!	N/A, MY	6 reviews	3

amazon	Eelasor, Idaho	2010-09-01T19:23:37Z	My experience with making purchases from Amazon has usually been a positive one.  However, in the event that a product I purchase is incorrect and the fault is from a third party seller, Amazon has often provided a refund or told me to keep the item.  There have also been times when experiencing certain issues regarding an item to be purchased, and  they have offered courtesy services such as free shipping or percentages off an item when applicable.For the most part, if someone search for good pricing deals they will find it here, especially for good used books and other good used products as well.

When I went to Amazon all of my personal information including my credit cards were stored on the Amazon.co.uk site. When I tried to get a refund for the order that was not delivered they told me i have to call the UK as the companies are separate? When I asked them if the companies are separate how come the UK Amazon has all of my personal information? They told me that they share information with all Amazon companies but if there is a problem with an order then the client has to call Amazon in the country where the order was placed?!? I wonder what the GDPR authorities have to say about such a casual attitude to the GDPR privacy protection law? I also live in a an apartment with another family and although we have separate Amazon accounts and Prime accounts, Amazon regularly mixes up our orders and cross utilizes our credit cards??

Also, Amazon intentionally inconveniences Non-Prime customers by delaying shipping for an unreasonable amount of time in an attempt to manipulate shoppers into buying Prime.Product prices are initially adjusted up to cover shipping, and then they want you to buy Prime in order to receive it in a reasonable amount of time. Prime two day delivery is nothing special, it's not offered on all products and often unreliable. I receive eBay and Walmart orders before Amazon. I placed three separate orders over a period of three days, only one showed ""shipped"" four days after placing the last order. It was the last order I placed that showed and It only shipped because I had attempted to cancel that order. The status just happened to change at the exact time I tried to cancel, so that I couldn't cancel. And, it sat in the warehouse for days after that.  Amazon may be a fair deal for customers who find enough value in the other services offered with Prime membership and shop enough to justify purchasing it. However, it is not a fair marketplace for the infrequent shopping non-Prime customer.Amazon no longer passes along savings to customers. Aside from initial pocketing, the company uses it's profits for huge advertising and massive expansion."	N/A, US	1 review	2
amazon	Luther Tan	2010-11-03T12:15:51Z	I believe giving them 3 stars is a fair rating. My experiences with Amazon is similar to a love hate relationship. At times, the items I ordered gets delivered on time and in perfect condition which I am very grateful of. But other times, my items are either slightly damaged or late. I had to return them and it will take ages for the item to be sent back before a replacement arrives. Dilemma indeed!	N/A, MY	6 reviews	3

amazon	Eelasor, Idaho	2010-09-01T19:23:37Z	My experience with making purchases from Amazon has usually been a positive one.  However, in the event that a product I purchase is incorrect and the fault is from a third party seller, Amazon has often provided a refund or told me to keep the item.  There have also been times when experiencing certain issues regarding an item to be purchased, and  they have offered courtesy services such as free shipping or percentages off an item when applicable.For the most part, if someone search for good pricing deals they will find it here, especially for good used books and other good used products as well.

When I went to Amazon all of my personal information including my credit cards were stored on the Amazon.co.uk site. When I tried to get a refund for the order that was not delivered they told me i have to call the UK as the companies are separate? When I asked them if the companies are separate how come the UK Amazon has all of my personal information? They told me that they share information with all Amazon companies but if there is a problem with an order then the client has to call Amazon in the country where the order was placed?!? I wonder what the GDPR authorities have to say about such a casual attitude to the GDPR privacy protection law? I also live in a an apartment with another family and although we have separate Amazon accounts and Prime accounts, Amazon regularly mixes up our orders and cross utilizes our credit cards?? I don't think that this is legal and when i complain to them it's ""well it's our policy""??? Terrible arrogant company."	N/A, US	4 reviews	1

I do not purchase anything for my business or home from them due to their  awful customer service when I was a paying Prime customer.  The csr's I have spoken to were not helpful and did not attempt to solve the two problems I have ever had to call about.   Both times I have called were about Amazon sold and fulfilled products that were faulty or defective and cost less than $20 each.   They only would say it was my problem and that I should get in touch with the manufacturer and that Amazon would do nothing and would not provide any assistance in getting product replaced.

amazon	Leo Terrell	2010-04-10T02:14:53Z	Everyone goes to the store to search for what they want and when it comes to online shopping it is very convenient. Amazon is a very well-known and great place to go online and shop for certain products. Although, Amazon is literally taking over the world and making businesses and companies out of business it is still the best online shopping place, because service can be extremely fast, there are lots of discounts on products, and the products are just very useful.My family has amazon prime and we can buy products and get them in two days. You even get discounts too, there was a product that my parents were gonna buy for $60, but with amazon prime the price went down to $20. Can you believe it? Although, many businesses and companies are going out of business, Amazon has everything you need at a good price and good shipping. Amazon is a very great place to shop and their products are always in good condition,  hopefully they never run out of business.	N/A, US	1 review	5

amazon	Eelasor, Idaho	2010-09-01T19:23:37Z	My experience with making purchases from Amazon has usually been a positive one.  However, in the event that a product I purchase is incorrect and the fault is from a third party seller, Amazon has often provided a refund or told me to keep the item.  There have also been times when experiencing certain issues regarding an item to be purchased, and  they have offered courtesy services such as free shipping or percentages off an item when applicable.For the most part, if someone search for good pricing deals they will find it here, especially for good used books and other good used products as well.

amazon	anthony genth	2010-07-14T11:19:41Z	"Amazon is too big and completely out of control! I placed an order with Amazon while traveling on business in the UK. When I went to Amazon all of my personal information including my credit cards were stored on the Amazon.co.uk site. When I tried to get a refund for the order that was not delivered they told me i have to call the UK as the companies are separate? When I asked them if the companies are separate how come the UK Amazon has all of my personal information? They told me that they share information with all Amazon companies but if there is a problem with an order then the client has to call Amazon in the country where the order was placed?!? I wonder what the GDPR authorities have to say about such a casual attitude to the GDPR privacy protection law? I also live in a an apartment with another family and although we have separate Amazon accounts and Prime accounts, Amazon regularly mixes up our orders and cross utilizes our credit cards?? I don't think that this is legal and when i complain to them it's ""well it's our policy""??? Terrible arrogant company."	N/A, US	4 reviews	1

amazon	dogtown23	2010-04-17T21:53:20Z	I have happily cut Amazon out of my life entirely.  I do not purchase anything for my business or home from them due to their  awful customer service when I was a paying Prime customer.  The csr's I have spoken to were not helpful and did not attempt to solve the two problems I have ever had to call about.   Both times I have called were about Amazon sold and fulfilled products that were faulty or defective and cost less than $20 each.   They only would say it was my problem and that I should get in touch with the manufacturer and that Amazon would do nothing and would not provide any assistance in getting product replaced.

amazon	Leo Terrell	2010-04-10T02:14:53Z	Everyone goes to the store to search for what they want and when it comes to online shopping it is very convenient. Amazon is a very well-known and great place to go online and shop for certain products. Although, Amazon is literally taking over the world and making businesses and companies out of business it is still the best online shopping place, because service can be extremely fast, there are lots of discounts on products, and the products are just very useful.My family has amazon prime and we can buy products and get them in two days. You even get discounts too, there was a product that my parents were gonna buy for $60, but with amazon prime the price went down to $20. Can you believe it? Although, many businesses and companies are going out of business, Amazon has everything you need at a good price and good shipping. Amazon is a very great place to shop and their products are always in good condition,  hopefully they never run out of business.	N/A, US	1 review	5

Also, Amazon intentionally inconveniences Non-Prime customers by delaying shipping for an unreasonable amount of time in an attempt to manipulate shoppers into buying Prime.Product prices are initially adjusted up to cover shipping, and then they want you to buy Prime in order to receive it in a reasonable amount of time. Prime two day delivery is nothing special, it's not offered on all products and often unreliable. I receive eBay and Walmart orders before Amazon. I placed three separate orders over a period of three days, only one showed ""shipped"" four days after placing the last order. It was the last order I placed that showed and It only shipped because I had attempted to cancel that order. The status just happened to change at the exact time I tried to cancel, so that I couldn't cancel. And, it sat in the warehouse for days after that.  Amazon may be a fair deal for customers who find enough value in the other services offered with Prime membership and shop enough to justify purchasing it. However, it is not a fair marketplace for the infrequent shopping non-Prime customer.Amazon no longer passes along savings to customers. Aside from initial pocketing, the company uses it's profits for huge advertising and massive expansion."	N/A, US	1 review	2

There have also been times when experiencing certain issues regarding an item to be purchased, and  they have offered courtesy services such as free shipping or percentages off an item when applicable.For the most part, if someone search for good pricing deals they will find it here, especially for good used books and other good used products as well.

amazon	anthony genth	2010-07-14T11:19:41Z	"Amazon is too big and completely out of control! I placed an order with Amazon while traveling on business in the UK. When I went to Amazon all of my personal information including my credit cards were stored on the Amazon.co.uk site. When I tried to get a refund for the order that was not delivered they told me i have to call the UK as the companies are separate? When I asked them if the companies are separate how come the UK Amazon has all of my personal information? They told me that they share information with all Amazon companies but if there is a problem with an order then the client has to call Amazon in the country where the order was placed?!? I wonder what the GDPR authorities have to say about such a casual attitude to the GDPR privacy protection law? I also live in a an apartment with another family and although we have separate Amazon accounts and Prime accounts, Amazon regularly mixes up our orders and cross utilizes our credit cards?? I don't think that this is legal and when i complain to them it's ""well it's our policy""??? Terrible arrogant company."	N/A, US	4 reviews	1

amazon	dogtown23	2010-04-17T21:53:20Z	I have happily cut Amazon out of my life entirely.  I do not purchase anything for my business or home from them due to their  awful customer service when I was a paying Prime customer.  The csr's I have spoken to were not helpful and did not attempt to solve the two problems I have ever had to call about.   Both times I have called were about Amazon sold and fulfilled products that were faulty or defective and cost less than $20 each.   They only would say it was my problem and that I should get in touch with the manufacturer and that Amazon would do nothing and would not provide any assistance in getting product replaced.

amazon	Leo Terrell	2010-04-10T02:14:53Z	Everyone goes to the store to search for what they want and when it comes to online shopping it is very convenient. Amazon is a very well-known and great place to go online and shop for certain products. Although, Amazon is literally taking over the world and making businesses and companies out of business it is still the best online shopping place, because service can be extremely fast, there are lots of discounts on products, and the products are just very useful.My family has amazon prime and we can buy products and get them in two days. You even get discounts too, there was a product that my parents were gonna buy for $60, but with amazon prime the price went down to $20. Can you believe it? Although, many businesses and companies are going out of business, Amazon has everything you need at a good price and good shipping. Amazon is a very great place to shop and their products are always in good condition,  hopefully they never run out of business.	N/A, US	1 review	5

amazon	Mick	2010-11-04T13:38:52Z	"Two options: 1) Average prices, lousy service and China slow delivery. 2) Average prices, lousy service, expensive shipping membership, same shipping time that other retailers offer for free.Amazon non-Prime customers receive a lower standard of customer service. Also, Amazon intentionally inconveniences Non-Prime customers by delaying shipping for an unreasonable amount of time in an attempt to manipulate shoppers into buying Prime.Product prices are initially adjusted up to cover shipping, and then they want you to buy Prime in order to receive it in a reasonable amount of time. Prime two day delivery is nothing special, it's not offered on all products and often unreliable. I receive eBay and Walmart orders before Amazon. I placed three separate orders over a period of three days, only one showed ""shipped"" four days after placing the last order. It was the last order I placed that showed and It only shipped because I had attempted to cancel that order. The status just happened to change at the exact time I tried to cancel, so that I couldn't cancel. And, it sat in the warehouse for days after that.  Amazon may be a fair deal for customers who find enough value in the other services offered with Prime membership and shop enough to justify purchasing it. However, it is not a fair marketplace for the infrequent shopping non-Prime customer.Amazon no longer passes along savings to customers. Aside from initial pocketing, the company uses it's profits for huge advertising and massive expansion."	N/A, US	1 review	2

amazon	Leo Terrell	2010-04-10T02:14:53Z	Everyone goes to the store to search for what they want and when it comes to online shopping it is very convenient. Amazon is a very well-known and great place to go online and shop for certain products. Although, Amazon is literally taking over the world and making businesses and companies out of business it is still the best online shopping place, because service can be extremely fast, there are lots of discounts on products, and the products are just very useful.My family has amazon prime and we can buy products and get them in two days. You even get discounts too, there was a product that my parents were gonna buy for $60, but with amazon prime the price went down to $20. Can you believe it? Although, many businesses and companies are going out of business, Amazon has everything you need at a good price and good shipping. Amazon is a very great place to shop and their products are always in good condition,  hopefully they never run out of business.	N/A, US	1 review	5

Also, Amazon intentionally inconveniences Non-Prime customers by delaying shipping for an unreasonable amount of time in an attempt to manipulate shoppers into buying Prime.Product prices are initially adjusted up to cover shipping, and then they want you to buy Prime in order to receive it in a reasonable amount of time. Prime two day delivery is nothing special, it's not offered on all products and often unreliable. I receive eBay and Walmart orders before Amazon. I placed three separate orders over a period of three days, only one showed ""shipped"" four days after placing the last order. It was the last order I placed that showed and It only shipped because I had attempted to cancel that order. The status just happened to change at the exact time I tried to cancel, so that I couldn't cancel. And, it sat in the warehouse for days after that.  Amazon may be a fair deal for customers who find enough value in the other services offered with Prime membership and shop enough to justify purchasing it. However, it is not a fair marketplace for the infrequent shopping non-Prime customer.Amazon no longer passes along savings to customers. Aside from initial pocketing, the company uses it's profits for huge advertising and massive expansion."	N/A, US	1 review	2

At times, the items I ordered gets delivered on time and in perfect condition which I am very grateful of. But other times, my items are either slightly damaged or late.

amazon	Eelasor, Idaho	2010-09-01T19:23:37Z	My experience with making purchases from Amazon has usually been a positive one.  However, in the event that a product I purchase is incorrect and the fault is from a third party seller, Amazon has often provided a refund or told me to keep the item.  There have also been times when experiencing certain issues regarding an item to be purchased, and  they have offered courtesy services such as free shipping or percentages off an item when applicable.For the most part, if someone search for good pricing deals they will find it here, especially for good used books and other good used products as well.

When I went to Amazon all of my personal information including my credit cards were stored on the Amazon.co.uk site.

When I asked them if the companies are separate how come the UK Amazon has all of my personal information? They told me that they share information with all Amazon companies but if there is a problem with an order then the client has to call Amazon in the country where the order was placed?!?

I also live in a an apartment with another family and although we have separate Amazon accounts and Prime accounts, Amazon regularly mixes up our orders and cross utilizes our credit cards??

amazon	Luther Tan	2010-11-03T12:15:51Z	I believe giving them 3 stars is a fair rating. My experiences with Amazon is similar to a love hate relationship. At times, the items I ordered gets delivered on time and in perfect condition which I am very grateful of. But other times, my items are either slightly damaged or late. I had to return them and it will take ages for the item to be sent back before a replacement arrives. Dilemma indeed!	N/A, MY	6 reviews	3

amazon	Eelasor, Idaho	2010-09-01T19:23:37Z	My experience with making purchases from Amazon has usually been a positive one.  However, in the event that a product I purchase is incorrect and the fault is from a third party seller, Amazon has often provided a refund or told me to keep the item.  There have also been times when experiencing certain issues regarding an item to be purchased, and  they have offered courtesy services such as free shipping or percentages off an item when applicable.For the most part, if someone search for good pricing deals they will find it here, especially for good used books and other good used products as well.

When I went to Amazon all of my personal information including my credit cards were stored on the Amazon.co.uk site. When I tried to get a refund for the order that was not delivered they told me i have to call the UK as the companies are separate? When I asked them if the companies are separate how come the UK Amazon has all of my personal information? They told me that they share information with all Amazon companies but if there is a problem with an order then the client has to call Amazon in the country where the order was placed?!? I wonder what the GDPR authorities have to say about such a casual attitude to the GDPR privacy protection law? I also live in a an apartment with another family and although we have separate Amazon accounts and Prime accounts, Amazon regularly mixes up our orders and cross utilizes our credit cards?? I don't think that this is legal and when i complain to them it's ""well it's our policy""??? Terrible arrogant company."	N/A, US	4 reviews	1

amazon	dogtown23	2010-04-17T21:53:20Z	I have happily cut Amazon out of my life entirely.  I do not purchase anything for my business or home from them due to their  awful customer service when I was a paying Prime customer.  The csr's I have spoken to were not helpful and did not attempt to solve the two problems I have ever had to call about.   Both times I have called were about Amazon sold and fulfilled products that were faulty or defective and cost less than $20 each.   They only would say it was my problem and that I should get in touch with the manufacturer and that Amazon would do nothing and would not provide any assistance in getting product replaced.

amazon	Leo Terrell	2010-04-10T02:14:53Z	Everyone goes to the store to search for what they want and when it comes to online shopping it is very convenient. Amazon is a very well-known and great place to go online and shop for certain products. Although, Amazon is literally taking over the world and making businesses and companies out of business it is still the best online shopping place, because service can be extremely fast, there are lots of discounts on products, and the products are just very useful.My family has amazon prime and we can buy products and get them in two days. You even get discounts too, there was a product that my parents were gonna buy for $60, but with amazon prime the price went down to $20. Can you believe it? Although, many businesses and companies are going out of business, Amazon has everything you need at a good price and good shipping. Amazon is a very great place to shop and their products are always in good condition,  hopefully they never run out of business.	N/A, US	1 review	5

amazon	Eelasor, Idaho	2010-09-01T19:23:37Z	My experience with making purchases from Amazon has usually been a positive one.  However, in the event that a product I purchase is incorrect and the fault is from a third party seller, Amazon has often provided a refund or told me to keep the item.  There have also been times when experiencing certain issues regarding an item to be purchased, and  they have offered courtesy services such as free shipping or percentages off an item when applicable.For the most part, if someone search for good pricing deals they will find it here, especially for good used books and other good used products as well.

amazon	anthony genth	2010-07-14T11:19:41Z	"Amazon is too big and completely out of control! I placed an order with Amazon while traveling on business in the UK. When I went to Amazon all of my personal information including my credit cards were stored on the Amazon.co.uk site. When I tried to get a refund for the order that was not delivered they told me i have to call the UK as the companies are separate? When I asked them if the companies are separate how come the UK Amazon has all of my personal information? They told me that they share information with all Amazon companies but if there is a problem with an order then the client has to call Amazon in the country where the order was placed?!? I wonder what the GDPR authorities have to say about such a casual attitude to the GDPR privacy protection law? I also live in a an apartment with another family and although we have separate Amazon accounts and Prime accounts, Amazon regularly mixes up our orders and cross utilizes our credit cards?? I don't think that this is legal and when i complain to them it's ""well it's our policy""??? Terrible arrogant company."	N/A, US	4 reviews	1

amazon	dogtown23	2010-04-17T21:53:20Z	I have happily cut Amazon out of my life entirely.  I do not purchase anything for my business or home from them due to their  awful customer service when I was a paying Prime customer.  The csr's I have spoken to were not helpful and did not attempt to solve the two problems I have ever had to call about.   Both times I have called were about Amazon sold and fulfilled products that were faulty or defective and cost less than $20 each.   They only would say it was my problem and that I should get in touch with the manufacturer and that Amazon would do nothing and would not provide any assistance in getting product replaced.

amazon	Leo Terrell	2010-04-10T02:14:53Z	Everyone goes to the store to search for what they want and when it comes to online shopping it is very convenient. Amazon is a very well-known and great place to go online and shop for certain products. Although, Amazon is literally taking over the world and making businesses and companies out of business it is still the best online shopping place, because service can be extremely fast, there are lots of discounts on products, and the products are just very useful.My family has amazon prime and we can buy products and get them in two days. You even get discounts too, there was a product that my parents were gonna buy for $60, but with amazon prime the price went down to $20. Can you believe it? Although, many businesses and companies are going out of business, Amazon has everything you need at a good price and good shipping. Amazon is a very great place to shop and their products are always in good condition,  hopefully they never run out of business.	N/A, US	1 review	5

amazon	Mick	2010-11-04T13:38:52Z	"Two options: 1) Average prices, lousy service and China slow delivery. 2) Average prices, lousy service, expensive shipping membership, same shipping time that other retailers offer for free.Amazon non-Prime customers receive a lower standard of customer service. Also, Amazon intentionally inconveniences Non-Prime customers by delaying shipping for an unreasonable amount of time in an attempt to manipulate shoppers into buying Prime.Product prices are initially adjusted up to cover shipping, and then they want you to buy Prime in order to receive it in a reasonable amount of time. Prime two day delivery is nothing special, it's not offered on all products and often unreliable. I receive eBay and Walmart orders before Amazon. I placed three separate orders over a period of three days, only one showed ""shipped"" four days after placing the last order. It was the last order I placed that showed and It only shipped because I had attempted to cancel that order. The status just happened to change at the exact time I tried to cancel, so that I couldn't cancel. And, it sat in the warehouse for days after that.  Amazon may be a fair deal for customers who find enough value in the other services offered with Prime membership and shop enough to justify purchasing it. However, it is not a fair marketplace for the infrequent shopping non-Prime customer.Amazon no longer passes along savings to customers. Aside from initial pocketing, the company uses it's profits for huge advertising and massive expansion."	N/A, US	1 review	2

amazon	dogtown23	2010-04-17T21:53:20Z	I have happily cut Amazon out of my life entirely.  I do not purchase anything for my business or home from them due to their  awful customer service when I was a paying Prime customer.  The csr's I have spoken to were not helpful and did not attempt to solve the two problems I have ever had to call about.   Both times I have called were about Amazon sold and fulfilled products that were faulty or defective and cost less than $20 each.   They only would say it was my problem and that I should get in touch with the manufacturer and that Amazon would do nothing and would not provide any assistance in getting product replaced.

amazon	Leo Terrell	2010-04-10T02:14:53Z	Everyone goes to the store to search for what they want and when it comes to online shopping it is very convenient. Amazon is a very well-known and great place to go online and shop for certain products. Although, Amazon is literally taking over the world and making businesses and companies out of business it is still the best online shopping place, because service can be extremely fast, there are lots of discounts on products, and the products are just very useful.My family has amazon prime and we can buy products and get them in two days. You even get discounts too, there was a product that my parents were gonna buy for $60, but with amazon prime the price went down to $20. Can you believe it? Although, many businesses and companies are going out of business, Amazon has everything you need at a good price and good shipping. Amazon is a very great place to shop and their products are always in good condition,  hopefully they never run out of business.	N/A, US	1 review	5

Also, Amazon intentionally inconveniences Non-Prime customers by delaying shipping for an unreasonable amount of time in an attempt to manipulate shoppers into buying Prime.Product prices are initially adjusted up to cover shipping, and then they want you to buy Prime in order to receive it in a reasonable amount of time. Prime two day delivery is nothing special, it's not offered on all products and often unreliable. I receive eBay and Walmart orders before Amazon. I placed three separate orders over a period of three days, only one showed ""shipped"" four days after placing the last order. It was the last order I placed that showed and It only shipped because I had attempted to cancel that order. The status just happened to change at the exact time I tried to cancel, so that I couldn't cancel. And, it sat in the warehouse for days after that.  Amazon may be a fair deal for customers who find enough value in the other services offered with Prime membership and shop enough to justify purchasing it. However, it is not a fair marketplace for the infrequent shopping non-Prime customer.Amazon no longer passes along savings to customers. Aside from initial pocketing, the company uses it's profits for huge advertising and massive expansion."	N/A, US	1 review	2
amazon	Luther Tan	2010-11-03T12:15:51Z	I believe giving them 3 stars is a fair rating. My experiences with Amazon is similar to a love hate relationship. At times, the items I ordered gets delivered on time and in perfect condition which I am very grateful of. But other times, my items are either slightly damaged or late. I had to return them and it will take ages for the item to be sent back before a replacement arrives. Dilemma indeed!	N/A, MY	6 reviews	3

amazon	Eelasor, Idaho	2010-09-01T19:23:37Z	My experience with making purchases from Amazon has usually been a positive one.  However, in the event that a product I purchase is incorrect and the fault is from a third party seller, Amazon has often provided a refund or told me to keep the item.  There have also been times when experiencing certain issues regarding an item to be purchased, and  they have offered courtesy services such as free shipping or percentages off an item when applicable.For the most part, if someone search for good pricing deals they will find it here, especially for good used books and other good used products as well.

When I went to Amazon all of my personal information including my credit cards were stored on the Amazon.co.uk site. When I tried to get a refund for the order that was not delivered they told me i have to call the UK as the companies are separate? When I asked them if the companies are separate how come the UK Amazon has all of my personal information? They told me that they share information with all Amazon companies but if there is a problem with an order then the client has to call Amazon in the country where the order was placed?!? I wonder what the GDPR authorities have to say about such a casual attitude to the GDPR privacy protection law? I also live in a an apartment with another family and although we have separate Amazon accounts and Prime accounts, Amazon regularly mixes up our orders and cross utilizes our credit cards??

Also, Amazon intentionally inconveniences Non-Prime customers by delaying shipping for an unreasonable amount of time in an attempt to manipulate shoppers into buying Prime.Product prices are initially adjusted up to cover shipping, and then they want you to buy Prime in order to receive it in a reasonable amount of time. Prime two day delivery is nothing special, it's not offered on all products and often unreliable. I receive eBay and Walmart orders before Amazon. I placed three separate orders over a period of three days, only one showed ""shipped"" four days after placing the last order. It was the last order I placed that showed and It only shipped because I had attempted to cancel that order. The status just happened to change at the exact time I tried to cancel, so that I couldn't cancel. And, it sat in the warehouse for days after that.  Amazon may be a fair deal for customers who find enough value in the other services offered with Prime membership and shop enough to justify purchasing it. However, it is not a fair marketplace for the infrequent shopping non-Prime customer.Amazon no longer passes along savings to customers. Aside from initial pocketing, the company uses it's profits for huge advertising and massive expansion."	N/A, US	1 review	2
amazon	Luther Tan	2010-11-03T12:15:51Z	I believe giving them 3 stars is a fair rating. My experiences with Amazon is similar to a love hate relationship. At times, the items I ordered gets delivered on time and in perfect condition which I am very grateful of. But other times, my items are either slightly damaged or late. I had to return them and it will take ages for the item to be sent back before a replacement arrives. Dilemma indeed!	N/A, MY	6 reviews	3

amazon	Eelasor, Idaho	2010-09-01T19:23:37Z	My experience with making purchases from Amazon has usually been a positive one.  However, in the event that a product I purchase is incorrect and the fault is from a third party seller, Amazon has often provided a refund or told me to keep the item.  There have also been times when experiencing certain issues regarding an item to be purchased, and  they have offered courtesy services such as free shipping or percentages off an item when applicable.For the most part, if someone search for good pricing deals they will find it here, especially for good used books and other good used products as well.

When I went to Amazon all of my personal information including my credit cards were stored on the Amazon.co.uk site. When I tried to get a refund for the order that was not delivered they told me i have to call the UK as the companies are separate? When I asked them if the companies are separate how come the UK Amazon has all of my personal information? They told me that they share information with all Amazon companies but if there is a problem with an order then the client has to call Amazon in the country where the order was placed?!? I wonder what the GDPR authorities have to say about such a casual attitude to the GDPR privacy protection law? I also live in a an apartment with another family and although we have separate Amazon accounts and Prime accounts, Amazon regularly mixes up our orders and cross utilizes our credit cards?? I don't think that this is legal and when i complain to them it's ""well it's our policy""??? Terrible arrogant company."	N/A, US	4 reviews	1

I do not purchase anything for my business or home from them due to their  awful customer service when I was a paying Prime customer.  The csr's I have spoken to were not helpful and did not attempt to solve the two problems I have ever had to call about.   Both times I have called were about Amazon sold and fulfilled products that were faulty or defective and cost less than $20 each.   They only would say it was my problem and that I should get in touch with the manufacturer and that Amazon would do nothing and would not provide any assistance in getting product replaced.

amazon	Leo Terrell	2010-04-10T02:14:53Z	Everyone goes to the store to search for what they want and when it comes to online shopping it is very convenient. Amazon is a very well-known and great place to go online and shop for certain products. Although, Amazon is literally taking over the world and making businesses and companies out of business it is still the best online shopping place, because service can be extremely fast, there are lots of discounts on products, and the products are just very useful.My family has amazon prime and we can buy products and get them in two days. You even get discounts too, there was a product that my parents were gonna buy for $60, but with amazon prime the price went down to $20. Can you believe it? Although, many businesses and companies are going out of business, Amazon has everything you need at a good price and good shipping. Amazon is a very great place to shop and their products are always in good condition,  hopefully they never run out of business.	N/A, US	1 review	5

amazon	Eelasor, Idaho	2010-09-01T19:23:37Z	My experience with making purchases from Amazon has usually been a positive one.  However, in the event that a product I purchase is incorrect and the fault is from a third party seller, Amazon has often provided a refund or told me to keep the item.  There have also been times when experiencing certain issues regarding an item to be purchased, and  they have offered courtesy services such as free shipping or percentages off an item when applicable.For the most part, if someone search for good pricing deals they will find it here, especially for good used books and other good used products as well.

amazon	anthony genth	2010-07-14T11:19:41Z	"Amazon is too big and completely out of control! I placed an order with Amazon while traveling on business in the UK. When I went to Amazon all of my personal information including my credit cards were stored on the Amazon.co.uk site. When I tried to get a refund for the order that was not delivered they told me i have to call the UK as the companies are separate? When I asked them if the companies are separate how come the UK Amazon has all of my personal information? They told me that they share information with all Amazon companies but if there is a problem with an order then the client has to call Amazon in the country where the order was placed?!? I wonder what the GDPR authorities have to say about such a casual attitude to the GDPR privacy protection law? I also live in a an apartment with another family and although we have separate Amazon accounts and Prime accounts, Amazon regularly mixes up our orders and cross utilizes our credit cards?? I don't think that this is legal and when i complain to them it's ""well it's our policy""??? Terrible arrogant company."	N/A, US	4 reviews	1

amazon	dogtown23	2010-04-17T21:53:20Z	I have happily cut Amazon out of my life entirely.  I do not purchase anything for my business or home from them due to their  awful customer service when I was a paying Prime customer.  The csr's I have spoken to were not helpful and did not attempt to solve the two problems I have ever had to call about.   Both times I have called were about Amazon sold and fulfilled products that were faulty or defective and cost less than $20 each.   They only would say it was my problem and that I should get in touch with the manufacturer and that Amazon would do nothing and would not provide any assistance in getting product replaced.

amazon	Leo Terrell	2010-04-10T02:14:53Z	Everyone goes to the store to search for what they want and when it comes to online shopping it is very convenient. Amazon is a very well-known and great place to go online and shop for certain products. Although, Amazon is literally taking over the world and making businesses and companies out of business it is still the best online shopping place, because service can be extremely fast, there are lots of discounts on products, and the products are just very useful.My family has amazon prime and we can buy products and get them in two days. You even get discounts too, there was a product that my parents were gonna buy for $60, but with amazon prime the price went down to $20. Can you believe it? Although, many businesses and companies are going out of business, Amazon has everything you need at a good price and good shipping. Amazon is a very great place to shop and their products are always in good condition,  hopefully they never run out of business.	N/A, US	1 review	5

Also, Amazon intentionally inconveniences Non-Prime customers by delaying shipping for an unreasonable amount of time in an attempt to manipulate shoppers into buying Prime.Product prices are initially adjusted up to cover shipping, and then they want you to buy Prime in order to receive it in a reasonable amount of time. Prime two day delivery is nothing special, it's not offered on all products and often unreliable. I receive eBay and Walmart orders before Amazon. I placed three separate orders over a period of three days, only one showed ""shipped"" four days after placing the last order. It was the last order I placed that showed and It only shipped because I had attempted to cancel that order. The status just happened to change at the exact time I tried to cancel, so that I couldn't cancel. And, it sat in the warehouse for days after that.  Amazon may be a fair deal for customers who find enough value in the other services offered with Prime membership and shop enough to justify purchasing it. However, it is not a fair marketplace for the infrequent shopping non-Prime customer.Amazon no longer passes along savings to customers. Aside from initial pocketing, the company uses it's profits for huge advertising and massive expansion."	N/A, US	1 review	2

There have also been times when experiencing certain issues regarding an item to be purchased, and  they have offered courtesy services such as free shipping or percentages off an item when applicable.For the most part, if someone search for good pricing deals they will find it here, especially for good used books and other good used products as well.

amazon	anthony genth	2010-07-14T11:19:41Z	"Amazon is too big and completely out of control! I placed an order with Amazon while traveling on business in the UK. When I went to Amazon all of my personal information including my credit cards were stored on the Amazon.co.uk site. When I tried to get a refund for the order that was not delivered they told me i have to call the UK as the companies are separate? When I asked them if the companies are separate how come the UK Amazon has all of my personal information? They told me that they share information with all Amazon companies but if there is a problem with an order then the client has to call Amazon in the country where the order was placed?!? I wonder what the GDPR authorities have to say about such a casual attitude to the GDPR privacy protection law? I also live in a an apartment with another family and although we have separate Amazon accounts and Prime accounts, Amazon regularly mixes up our orders and cross utilizes our credit cards?? I don't think that this is legal and when i complain to them it's ""well it's our policy""??? Terrible arrogant company."	N/A, US	4 reviews	1

amazon	dogtown23	2010-04-17T21:53:20Z	I have happily cut Amazon out of my life entirely.  I do not purchase anything for my business or home from them due to their  awful customer service when I was a paying Prime customer.  The csr's I have spoken to were not helpful and did not attempt to solve the two problems I have ever had to call about.   Both times I have called were about Amazon sold and fulfilled products that were faulty or defective and cost less than $20 each.   They only would say it was my problem and that I should get in touch with the manufacturer and that Amazon would do nothing and would not provide any assistance in getting product replaced.

amazon	Leo Terrell	2010-04-10T02:14:53Z	Everyone goes to the store to search for what they want and when it comes to online shopping it is very convenient. Amazon is a very well-known and great place to go online and shop for certain products. Although, Amazon is literally taking over the world and making businesses and companies out of business it is still the best online shopping place, because service can be extremely fast, there are lots of discounts on products, and the products are just very useful.My family has amazon prime and we can buy products and get them in two days. You even get discounts too, there was a product that my parents were gonna buy for $60, but with amazon prime the price went down to $20. Can you believe it? Although, many businesses and companies are going out of business, Amazon has everything you need at a good price and good shipping. Amazon is a very great place to shop and their products are always in good condition,  hopefully they never run out of business.	N/A, US	1 review	5

amazon	Mick	2010-11-04T13:38:52Z	"Two options: 1) Average prices, lousy service and China slow delivery. 2) Average prices, lousy service, expensive shipping membership, same shipping time that other retailers offer for free.Amazon non-Prime customers receive a lower standard of customer service. Also, Amazon intentionally inconveniences Non-Prime customers by delaying shipping for an unreasonable amount of time in an attempt to manipulate shoppers into buying Prime.Product prices are initially adjusted up to cover shipping, and then they want you to buy Prime in order to receive it in a reasonable amount of time. Prime two day delivery is nothing special, it's not offered on all products and often unreliable. I receive eBay and Walmart orders before Amazon. I placed three separate orders over a period of three days, only one showed ""shipped"" four days after placing the last order. It was the last order I placed that showed and It only shipped because I had attempted to cancel that order. The status just happened to change at the exact time I tried to cancel, so that I couldn't cancel. And, it sat in the warehouse for days after that.  Amazon may be a fair deal for customers who find enough value in the other services offered with Prime membership and shop enough to justify purchasing it. However, it is not a fair marketplace for the infrequent shopping non-Prime customer.Amazon no longer passes along savings to customers. Aside from initial pocketing, the company uses it's profits for huge advertising and massive expansion."	N/A, US	1 review	2

amazon	Leo Terrell	2010-04-10T02:14:53Z	Everyone goes to the store to search for what they want and when it comes to online shopping it is very convenient. Amazon is a very well-known and great place to go online and shop for certain products. Although, Amazon is literally taking over the world and making businesses and companies out of business it is still the best online shopping place, because service can be extremely fast, there are lots of discounts on products, and the products are just very useful.My family has amazon prime and we can buy products and get them in two days. You even get discounts too, there was a product that my parents were gonna buy for $60, but with amazon prime the price went down to $20. Can you believe it? Although, many businesses and companies are going out of business, Amazon has everything you need at a good price and good shipping. Amazon is a very great place to shop and their products are always in good condition,  hopefully they never run out of business.	N/A, US	1 review	5

Also, Amazon intentionally inconveniences Non-Prime customers by delaying shipping for an unreasonable amount of time in an attempt to manipulate shoppers into buying Prime.Product prices are initially adjusted up to cover shipping, and then they want you to buy Prime in order to receive it in a reasonable amount of time. Prime two day delivery is nothing special, it's not offered on all products and often unreliable. I receive eBay and Walmart orders before Amazon. I placed three separate orders over a period of three days, only one showed ""shipped"" four days after placing the last order. It was the last order I placed that showed and It only shipped because I had attempted to cancel that order. The status just happened to change at the exact time I tried to cancel, so that I couldn't cancel. And, it sat in the warehouse for days after that.  Amazon may be a fair deal for customers who find enough value in the other services offered with Prime membership and shop enough to justify purchasing it. However, it is not a fair marketplace for the infrequent shopping non-Prime customer.Amazon no longer passes along savings to customers. Aside from initial pocketing, the company uses it's profits for huge advertising and massive expansion."	N/A, US	1 review	2

At times, the items I ordered gets delivered on time and in perfect condition which I am very grateful of. But other times, my items are either slightly damaged or late.

amazon	Eelasor, Idaho	2010-09-01T19:23:37Z	My experience with making purchases from Amazon has usually been a positive one.  However, in the event that a product I purchase is incorrect and the fault is from a third party seller, Amazon has often provided a refund or told me to keep the item.  There have also been times when experiencing certain issues regarding an item to be purchased, and  they have offered courtesy services such as free shipping or percentages off an item when applicable.For the most part, if someone search for good pricing deals they will find it here, especially for good used books and other good used products as well.

When I went to Amazon all of my personal information including my credit cards were stored on the Amazon.co.uk site.

When I asked them if the companies are separate how come the UK Amazon has all of my personal information? They told me that they share information with all Amazon companies but if there is a problem with an order then the client has to call Amazon in the country where the order was placed?!?

I also live in a an apartment with another family and although we have separate Amazon accounts and Prime accounts, Amazon regularly mixes up our orders and cross utilizes our credit cards??

amazon	Luther Tan	2010-11-03T12:15:51Z	I believe giving them 3 stars is a fair rating. My experiences with Amazon is similar to a love hate relationship. At times, the items I ordered gets delivered on time and in perfect condition which I am very grateful of. But other times, my items are either slightly damaged or late. I had to return them and it will take ages for the item to be sent back before a replacement arrives. Dilemma indeed!	N/A, MY	6 reviews	3

amazon	Eelasor, Idaho	2010-09-01T19:23:37Z	My experience with making purchases from Amazon has usually been a positive one.  However, in the event that a product I purchase is incorrect and the fault is from a third party seller, Amazon has often provided a refund or told me to keep the item.  There have also been times when experiencing certain issues regarding an item to be purchased, and  they have offered courtesy services such as free shipping or percentages off an item when applicable.For the most part, if someone search for good pricing deals they will find it here, especially for good used books and other good used products as well.

When I went to Amazon all of my personal information including my credit cards were stored on the Amazon.co.uk site. When I tried to get a refund for the order that was not delivered they told me i have to call the UK as the companies are separate? When I asked them if the companies are separate how come the UK Amazon has all of my personal information? They told me that they share information with all Amazon companies but if there is a problem with an order then the client has to call Amazon in the country where the order was placed?!? I wonder what the GDPR authorities have to say about such a casual attitude to the GDPR privacy protection law? I also live in a an apartment with another family and although we have separate Amazon accounts and Prime accounts, Amazon regularly mixes up our orders and cross utilizes our credit cards?? I don't think that this is legal and when i complain to them it's ""well it's our policy""??? Terrible arrogant company."	N/A, US	4 reviews	1

amazon	dogtown23	2010-04-17T21:53:20Z	I have happily cut Amazon out of my life entirely.  I do not purchase anything for my business or home from them due to their  awful customer service when I was a paying Prime customer.  The csr's I have spoken to were not helpful and did not attempt to solve the two problems I have ever had to call about.   Both times I have called were about Amazon sold and fulfilled products that were faulty or defective and cost less than $20 each.   They only would say it was my problem and that I should get in touch with the manufacturer and that Amazon would do nothing and would not provide any assistance in getting product replaced.

amazon	Leo Terrell	2010-04-10T02:14:53Z	Everyone goes to the store to search for what they want and when it comes to online shopping it is very convenient. Amazon is a very well-known and great place to go online and shop for certain products. Although, Amazon is literally taking over the world and making businesses and companies out of business it is still the best online shopping place, because service can be extremely fast, there are lots of discounts on products, and the products are just very useful.My family has amazon prime and we can buy products and get them in two days. You even get discounts too, there was a product that my parents were gonna buy for $60, but with amazon prime the price went down to $20. Can you believe it? Although, many businesses and companies are going out of business, Amazon has everything you need at a good price and good shipping. Amazon is a very great place to shop and their products are always in good condition,  hopefully they never run out of business.	N/A, US	1 review	5

amazon	Eelasor, Idaho	2010-09-01T19:23:37Z	My experience with making purchases from Amazon has usually been a positive one.  However, in the event that a product I purchase is incorrect and the fault is from a third party seller, Amazon has often provided a refund or told me to keep the item.  There have also been times when experiencing certain issues regarding an item to be purchased, and  they have offered courtesy services such as free shipping or percentages off an item when applicable.For the most part, if someone search for good pricing deals they will find it here, especially for good used books and other good used products as well.

amazon	anthony genth	2010-07-14T11:19:41Z	"Amazon is too big and completely out of control! I placed an order with Amazon while traveling on business in the UK. When I went to Amazon all of my personal information including my credit cards were stored on the Amazon.co.uk site. When I tried to get a refund for the order that was not delivered they told me i have to call the UK as the companies are separate? When I asked them if the companies are separate how come the UK Amazon has all of my personal information? They told me that they share information with all Amazon companies but if there is a problem with an order then the client has to call Amazon in the country where the order was placed?!? I wonder what the GDPR authorities have to say about such a casual attitude to the GDPR privacy protection law? I also live in a an apartment with another family and although we have separate Amazon accounts and Prime accounts, Amazon regularly mixes up our orders and cross utilizes our credit cards?? I don't think that this is legal and when i complain to them it's ""well it's our policy""??? Terrible arrogant company."	N/A, US	4 reviews	1

amazon	dogtown23	2010-04-17T21:53:20Z	I have happily cut Amazon out of my life entirely.  I do not purchase anything for my business or home from them due to their  awful customer service when I was a paying Prime customer.  The csr's I have spoken to were not helpful and did not attempt to solve the two problems I have ever had to call about.   Both times I have called were about Amazon sold and fulfilled products that were faulty or defective and cost less than $20 each.   They only would say it was my problem and that I should get in touch with the manufacturer and that Amazon would do nothing and would not provide any assistance in getting product replaced.

amazon	Leo Terrell	2010-04-10T02:14:53Z	Everyone goes to the store to search for what they want and when it comes to online shopping it is very convenient. Amazon is a very well-known and great place to go online and shop for certain products. Although, Amazon is literally taking over the world and making businesses and companies out of business it is still the best online shopping place, because service can be extremely fast, there are lots of discounts on products, and the products are just very useful.My family has amazon prime and we can buy products and get them in two days. You even get discounts too, there was a product that my parents were gonna buy for $60, but with amazon prime the price went down to $20. Can you believe it? Although, many businesses and companies are going out of business, Amazon has everything you need at a good price and good shipping. Amazon is a very great place to shop and their products are always in good condition,  hopefully they never run out of business.	N/A, US	1 review	5

amazon	Mick	2010-11-04T13:38:52Z	"Two options: 1) Average prices, lousy service and China slow delivery. 2) Average prices, lousy service, expensive shipping membership, same shipping time that other retailers offer for free.Amazon non-Prime customers receive a lower standard of customer service. Also, Amazon intentionally inconveniences Non-Prime customers by delaying shipping for an unreasonable amount of time in an attempt to manipulate shoppers into buying Prime.Product prices are initially adjusted up to cover shipping, and then they want you to buy Prime in order to receive it in a reasonable amount of time. Prime two day delivery is nothing special, it's not offered on all products and often unreliable. I receive eBay and Walmart orders before Amazon. I placed three separate orders over a period of three days, only one showed ""shipped"" four days after placing the last order. It was the last order I placed that showed and It only shipped because I had attempted to cancel that order. The status just happened to change at the exact time I tried to cancel, so that I couldn't cancel. And, it sat in the warehouse for days after that.  Amazon may be a fair deal for customers who find enough value in the other services offered with Prime membership and shop enough to justify purchasing it. However, it is not a fair marketplace for the infrequent shopping non-Prime customer.Amazon no longer passes along savings to customers. Aside from initial pocketing, the company uses it's profits for huge advertising and massive expansion."	N/A, US	1 review	2

amazon	dogtown23	2010-04-17T21:53:20Z	I have happily cut Amazon out of my life entirely.  I do not purchase anything for my business or home from them due to their  awful customer service when I was a paying Prime customer.  The csr's I have spoken to were not helpful and did not attempt to solve the two problems I have ever had to call about.   Both times I have called were about Amazon sold and fulfilled products that were faulty or defective and cost less than $20 each.   They only would say it was my problem and that I should get in touch with the manufacturer and that Amazon would do nothing and would not provide any assistance in getting product replaced.

amazon	Leo Terrell	2010-04-10T02:14:53Z	Everyone goes to the store to search for what they want and when it comes to online shopping it is very convenient. Amazon is a very well-known and great place to go online and shop for certain products. Although, Amazon is literally taking over the world and making businesses and companies out of business it is still the best online shopping place, because service can be extremely fast, there are lots of discounts on products, and the products are just very useful.My family has amazon prime and we can buy products and get them in two days. You even get discounts too, there was a product that my parents were gonna buy for $60, but with amazon prime the price went down to $20. Can you believe it? Although, many businesses and companies are going out of business, Amazon has everything you need at a good price and good shipping. Amazon is a very great place to shop and their products are always in good condition,  hopefully they never run out of business.	N/A, US	1 review	5

Also, Amazon intentionally inconveniences Non-Prime customers by delaying shipping for an unreasonable amount of time in an attempt to manipulate shoppers into buying Prime.Product prices are initially adjusted up to cover shipping, and then they want you to buy Prime in order to receive it in a reasonable amount of time. Prime two day delivery is nothing special, it's not offered on all products and often unreliable. I receive eBay and Walmart orders before Amazon. I placed three separate orders over a period of three days, only one showed ""shipped"" four days after placing the last order. It was the last order I placed that showed and It only shipped because I had attempted to cancel that order. The status just happened to change at the exact time I tried to cancel, so that I couldn't cancel. And, it sat in the warehouse for days after that.  Amazon may be a fair deal for customers who find enough value in the other services offered with Prime membership and shop enough to justify purchasing it. However, it is not a fair marketplace for the infrequent shopping non-Prime customer.Amazon no longer passes along savings to customers. Aside from initial pocketing, the company uses it's profits for huge advertising and massive expansion."	N/A, US	1 review	2
amazon	Luther Tan	2010-11-03T12:15:51Z	I believe giving them 3 stars is a fair rating. My experiences with Amazon is similar to a love hate relationship. At times, the items I ordered gets delivered on time and in perfect condition which I am very grateful of. But other times, my items are either slightly damaged or late. I had to return them and it will take ages for the item to be sent back before a replacement arrives. Dilemma indeed!	N/A, MY	6 reviews	3

amazon	Eelasor, Idaho	2010-09-01T19:23:37Z	My experience with making purchases from Amazon has usually been a positive one.  However, in the event that a product I purchase is incorrect and the fault is from a third party seller, Amazon has often provided a refund or told me to keep the item.  There have also been times when experiencing certain issues regarding an item to be purchased, and  they have offered courtesy services such as free shipping or percentages off an item when applicable.For the most part, if someone search for good pricing deals they will find it here, especially for good used books and other good used products as well.

When I went to Amazon all of my personal information including my credit cards were stored on the Amazon.co.uk site. When I tried to get a refund for the order that was not delivered they told me i have to call the UK as the companies are separate? When I asked them if the companies are separate how come the UK Amazon has all of my personal information? They told me that they share information with all Amazon companies but if there is a problem with an order then the client has to call Amazon in the country where the order was placed?!? I wonder what the GDPR authorities have to say about such a casual attitude to the GDPR privacy protection law? I also live in a an apartment with another family and although we have separate Amazon accounts and Prime accounts, Amazon regularly mixes up our orders and cross utilizes our credit cards??

Also, Amazon intentionally inconveniences Non-Prime customers by delaying shipping for an unreasonable amount of time in an attempt to manipulate shoppers into buying Prime.Product prices are initially adjusted up to cover shipping, and then they want you to buy Prime in order to receive it in a reasonable amount of time. Prime two day delivery is nothing special, it's not offered on all products and often unreliable. I receive eBay and Walmart orders before Amazon. I placed three separate orders over a period of three days, only one showed ""shipped"" four days after placing the last order. It was the last order I placed that showed and It only shipped because I had attempted to cancel that order. The status just happened to change at the exact time I tried to cancel, so that I couldn't cancel. And, it sat in the warehouse for days after that.  Amazon may be a fair deal for customers who find enough value in the other services offered with Prime membership and shop enough to justify purchasing it. However, it is not a fair marketplace for the infrequent shopping non-Prime customer.Amazon no longer passes along savings to customers. Aside from initial pocketing, the company uses it's profits for huge advertising and massive expansion."	N/A, US	1 review	2
amazon	Luther Tan	2010-11-03T12:15:51Z	I believe giving them 3 stars is a fair rating. My experiences with Amazon is similar to a love hate relationship. At times, the items I ordered gets delivered on time and in perfect condition which I am very grateful of. But other times, my items are either slightly damaged or late. I had to return them and it will take ages for the item to be sent back before a replacement arrives. Dilemma indeed!	N/A, MY	6 reviews	3

amazon	Eelasor, Idaho	2010-09-01T19:23:37Z	My experience with making purchases from Amazon has usually been a positive one.  However, in the event that a product I purchase is incorrect and the fault is from a third party seller, Amazon has often provided a refund or told me to keep the item.  There have also been times when experiencing certain issues regarding an item to be purchased, and  they have offered courtesy services such as free shipping or percentages off an item when applicable.For the most part, if someone search for good pricing deals they will find it here, especially for good used books and other good used products as well.

When I went to Amazon all of my personal information including my credit cards were stored on the Amazon.co.uk site. When I tried to get a refund for the order that was not delivered they told me i have to call the UK as the companies are separate? When I asked them if the companies are separate how come the UK Amazon has all of my personal information? They told me that they share information with all Amazon companies but if there is a problem with an order then the client has to call Amazon in the country where the order was placed?!? I wonder what the GDPR authorities have to say about such a casual attitude to the GDPR privacy protection law? I also live in a an apartment with another family and although we have separate Amazon accounts and Prime accounts, Amazon regularly mixes up our orders and cross utilizes our credit cards?? I don't think that this is legal and when i complain to them it's ""well it's our policy""??? Terrible arrogant company."	N/A, US	4 reviews	1

I do not purchase anything for my business or home from them due to their  awful customer service when I was a paying Prime customer.  The csr's I have spoken to were not helpful and did not attempt to solve the two problems I have ever had to call about.   Both times I have called were about Amazon sold and fulfilled products that were faulty or defective and cost less than $20 each.   They only would say it was my problem and that I should get in touch with the manufacturer and that Amazon would do nothing and would not provide any assistance in getting product replaced.

amazon	Leo Terrell	2010-04-10T02:14:53Z	Everyone goes to the store to search for what they want and when it comes to online shopping it is very convenient. Amazon is a very well-known and great place to go online and shop for certain products. Although, Amazon is literally taking over the world and making businesses and companies out of business it is still the best online shopping place, because service can be extremely fast, there are lots of discounts on products, and the products are just very useful.My family has amazon prime and we can buy products and get them in two days. You even get discounts too, there was a product that my parents were gonna buy for $60, but with amazon prime the price went down to $20. Can you believe it? Although, many businesses and companies are going out of business, Amazon has everything you need at a good price and good shipping. Amazon is a very great place to shop and their products are always in good condition,  hopefully they never run out of business.	N/A, US	1 review	5

amazon	Eelasor, Idaho	2010-09-01T19:23:37Z	My experience with making purchases from Amazon has usually been a positive one.  However, in the event that a product I purchase is incorrect and the fault is from a third party seller, Amazon has often provided a refund or told me to keep the item.  There have also been times when experiencing certain issues regarding an item to be purchased, and  they have offered courtesy services such as free shipping or percentages off an item when applicable.For the most part, if someone search for good pricing deals they will find it here, especially for good used books and other good used products as well.

amazon	anthony genth	2010-07-14T11:19:41Z	"Amazon is too big and completely out of control! I placed an order with Amazon while traveling on business in the UK. When I went to Amazon all of my personal information including my credit cards were stored on the Amazon.co.uk site. When I tried to get a refund for the order that was not delivered they told me i have to call the UK as the companies are separate? When I asked them if the companies are separate how come the UK Amazon has all of my personal information? They told me that they share information with all Amazon companies but if there is a problem with an order then the client has to call Amazon in the country where the order was placed?!? I wonder what the GDPR authorities have to say about such a casual attitude to the GDPR privacy protection law? I also live in a an apartment with another family and although we have separate Amazon accounts and Prime accounts, Amazon regularly mixes up our orders and cross utilizes our credit cards?? I don't think that this is legal and when i complain to them it's ""well it's our policy""??? Terrible arrogant company."	N/A, US	4 reviews	1

amazon	dogtown23	2010-04-17T21:53:20Z	I have happily cut Amazon out of my life entirely.  I do not purchase anything for my business or home from them due to their  awful customer service when I was a paying Prime customer.  The csr's I have spoken to were not helpful and did not attempt to solve the two problems I have ever had to call about.   Both times I have called were about Amazon sold and fulfilled products that were faulty or defective and cost less than $20 each.   They only would say it was my problem and that I should get in touch with the manufacturer and that Amazon would do nothing and would not provide any assistance in getting product replaced.

amazon	Leo Terrell	2010-04-10T02:14:53Z	Everyone goes to the store to search for what they want and when it comes to online shopping it is very convenient. Amazon is a very well-known and great place to go online and shop for certain products. Although, Amazon is literally taking over the world and making businesses and companies out of business it is still the best online shopping place, because service can be extremely fast, there are lots of discounts on products, and the products are just very useful.My family has amazon prime and we can buy products and get them in two days. You even get discounts too, there was a product that my parents were gonna buy for $60, but with amazon prime the price went down to $20. Can you believe it? Although, many businesses and companies are going out of business, Amazon has everything you need at a good price and good shipping. Amazon is a very great place to shop and their products are always in good condition,  hopefully they never run out of business.	N/A, US	1 review	5

Also, Amazon intentionally inconveniences Non-Prime customers by delaying shipping for an unreasonable amount of time in an attempt to manipulate shoppers into buying Prime.Product prices are initially adjusted up to cover shipping, and then they want you to buy Prime in order to receive it in a reasonable amount of time. Prime two day delivery is nothing special, it's not offered on all products and often unreliable. I receive eBay and Walmart orders before Amazon. I placed three separate orders over a period of three days, only one showed ""shipped"" four days after placing the last order. It was the last order I placed that showed and It only shipped because I had attempted to cancel that order. The status just happened to change at the exact time I tried to cancel, so that I couldn't cancel. And, it sat in the warehouse for days after that.  Amazon may be a fair deal for customers who find enough value in the other services offered with Prime membership and shop enough to justify purchasing it. However, it is not a fair marketplace for the infrequent shopping non-Prime customer.Amazon no longer passes along savings to customers. Aside from initial pocketing, the company uses it's profits for huge advertising and massive expansion."	N/A, US	1 review	2

There have also been times when experiencing certain issues regarding an item to be purchased, and  they have offered courtesy services such as free shipping or percentages off an item when applicable.For the most part, if someone search for good pricing deals they will find it here, especially for good used books and other good used products as well.

amazon	anthony genth	2010-07-14T11:19:41Z	"Amazon is too big and completely out of control! I placed an order with Amazon while traveling on business in the UK. When I went to Amazon all of my personal information including my credit cards were stored on the Amazon.co.uk site. When I tried to get a refund for the order that was not delivered they told me i have to call the UK as the companies are separate? When I asked them if the companies are separate how come the UK Amazon has all of my personal information? They told me that they share information with all Amazon companies but if there is a problem with an order then the client has to call Amazon in the country where the order was placed?!? I wonder what the GDPR authorities have to say about such a casual attitude to the GDPR privacy protection law? I also live in a an apartment with another family and although we have separate Amazon accounts and Prime accounts, Amazon regularly mixes up our orders and cross utilizes our credit cards?? I don't think that this is legal and when i complain to them it's ""well it's our policy""??? Terrible arrogant company."	N/A, US	4 reviews	1

amazon	dogtown23	2010-04-17T21:53:20Z	I have happily cut Amazon out of my life entirely.  I do not purchase anything for my business or home from them due to their  awful customer service when I was a paying Prime customer.  The csr's I have spoken to were not helpful and did not attempt to solve the two problems I have ever had to call about.   Both times I have called were about Amazon sold and fulfilled products that were faulty or defective and cost less than $20 each.   They only would say it was my problem and that I should get in touch with the manufacturer and that Amazon would do nothing and would not provide any assistance in getting product replaced.

amazon	Leo Terrell	2010-04-10T02:14:53Z	Everyone goes to the store to search for what they want and when it comes to online shopping it is very convenient. Amazon is a very well-known and great place to go online and shop for certain products. Although, Amazon is literally taking over the world and making businesses and companies out of business it is still the best online shopping place, because service can be extremely fast, there are lots of discounts on products, and the products are just very useful.My family has amazon prime and we can buy products and get them in two days. You even get discounts too, there was a product that my parents were gonna buy for $60, but with amazon prime the price went down to $20. Can you believe it? Although, many businesses and companies are going out of business, Amazon has everything you need at a good price and good shipping. Amazon is a very great place to shop and their products are always in good condition,  hopefully they never run out of business.	N/A, US	1 review	5

amazon	Mick	2010-11-04T13:38:52Z	"Two options: 1) Average prices, lousy service and China slow delivery. 2) Average prices, lousy service, expensive shipping membership, same shipping time that other retailers offer for free.Amazon non-Prime customers receive a lower standard of customer service. Also, Amazon intentionally inconveniences Non-Prime customers by delaying shipping for an unreasonable amount of time in an attempt to manipulate shoppers into buying Prime.Product prices are initially adjusted up to cover shipping, and then they want you to buy Prime in order to receive it in a reasonable amount of time. Prime two day delivery is nothing special, it's not offered on all products and often unreliable. I receive eBay and Walmart orders before Amazon. I placed three separate orders over a period of three days, only one showed ""shipped"" four days after placing the last order. It was the last order I placed that showed and It only shipped because I had attempted to cancel that order. The status just happened to change at the exact time I tried to cancel, so that I couldn't cancel. And, it sat in the warehouse for days after that.  Amazon may be a fair deal for customers who find enough value in the other services offered with Prime membership and shop enough to justify purchasing it. However, it is not a fair marketplace for the infrequent shopping non-Prime customer.Amazon no longer passes along savings to customers. Aside from initial pocketing, the company uses it's profits for huge advertising and massive expansion."	N/A, US	1 review	2

amazon	Leo Terrell	2010-04-10T02:14:53Z	Everyone goes to the store to search for what they want and when it comes to online shopping it is very convenient. Amazon is a very well-known and great place to go online and shop for certain products. Although, Amazon is literally taking over the world and making businesses and companies out of business it is still the best online shopping place, because service can be extremely fast, there are lots of discounts on products, and the products are just very useful.My family has amazon prime and we can buy products and get them in two days. You even get discounts too, there was a product that my parents were gonna buy for $60, but with amazon prime the price went down to $20. Can you believe it? Although, many businesses and companies are going out of business, Amazon has everything you need at a good price and good shipping. Amazon is a very great place to shop and their products are always in good condition,  hopefully they never run out of business.	N/A, US	1 review	5

Also, Amazon intentionally inconveniences Non-Prime customers by delaying shipping for an unreasonable amount of time in an attempt to manipulate shoppers into buying Prime.Product prices are initially adjusted up to cover shipping, and then they want you to buy Prime in order to receive it in a reasonable amount of time. Prime two day delivery is nothing special, it's not offered on all products and often unreliable. I receive eBay and Walmart orders before Amazon. I placed three separate orders over a period of three days, only one showed ""shipped"" four days after placing the last order. It was the last order I placed that showed and It only shipped because I had attempted to cancel that order. The status just happened to change at the exact time I tried to cancel, so that I couldn't cancel. And, it sat in the warehouse for days after that.  Amazon may be a fair deal for customers who find enough value in the other services offered with Prime membership and shop enough to justify purchasing it. However, it is not a fair marketplace for the infrequent shopping non-Prime customer.Amazon no longer passes along savings to customers. Aside from initial pocketing, the company uses it's profits for huge advertising and massive expansion."	N/A, US	1 review	2

At times, the items I ordered gets delivered on time and in perfect condition which I am very grateful of. But other times, my items are either slightly damaged or late.

amazon	Eelasor, Idaho	2010-09-01T19:23:37Z	My experience with making purchases from Amazon has usually been a positive one.  However, in the event that a product I purchase is incorrect and the fault is from a third party seller, Amazon has often provided a refund or told me to keep the item.  There have also been times when experiencing certain issues regarding an item to be purchased, and  they have offered courtesy services such as free shipping or percentages off an item when applicable.For the most part, if someone search for good pricing deals they will find it here, especially for good used books and other good used products as well.

When I went to Amazon all of my personal information including my credit cards were stored on the Amazon.co.uk site.

When I asked them if the companies are separate how come the UK Amazon has all of my personal information? They told me that they share information with all Amazon companies but if there is a problem with an order then the client has to call Amazon in the country where the order was placed?!?

I also live in a an apartment with another family and although we have separate Amazon accounts and Prime accounts, Amazon regularly mixes up our orders and cross utilizes our credit cards??

amazon	Luther Tan	2010-11-03T12:15:51Z	I believe giving them 3 stars is a fair rating. My experiences with Amazon is similar to a love hate relationship. At times, the items I ordered gets delivered on time and in perfect condition which I am very grateful of. But other times, my items are either slightly damaged or late. I had to return them and it will take ages for the item to be sent back before a replacement arrives. Dilemma indeed!	N/A, MY	6 reviews	3

amazon	Eelasor, Idaho	2010-09-01T19:23:37Z	My experience with making purchases from Amazon has usually been a positive one.  However, in the event that a product I purchase is incorrect and the fault is from a third party seller, Amazon has often provided a refund or told me to keep the item.  There have also been times when experiencing certain issues regarding an item to be purchased, and  they have offered courtesy services such as free shipping or percentages off an item when applicable.For the most part, if someone search for good pricing deals they will find it here, especially for good used books and other good used products as well.

When I went to Amazon all of my personal information including my credit cards were stored on the Amazon.co.uk site. When I tried to get a refund for the order that was not delivered they told me i have to call the UK as the companies are separate? When I asked them if the companies are separate how come the UK Amazon has all of my personal information? They told me that they share information with all Amazon companies but if there is a problem with an order then the client has to call Amazon in the country where the order was placed?!? I wonder what the GDPR authorities have to say about such a casual attitude to the GDPR privacy protection law? I also live in a an apartment with another family and although we have separate Amazon accounts and Prime accounts, Amazon regularly mixes up our orders and cross utilizes our credit cards?? I don't think that this is legal and when i complain to them it's ""well it's our policy""??? Terrible arrogant company."	N/A, US	4 reviews	1

amazon	dogtown23	2010-04-17T21:53:20Z	I have happily cut Amazon out of my life entirely.  I do not purchase anything for my business or home from them due to their  awful customer service when I was a paying Prime customer.  The csr's I have spoken to were not helpful and did not attempt to solve the two problems I have ever had to call about.   Both times I have called were about Amazon sold and fulfilled products that were faulty or defective and cost less than $20 each.   They only would say it was my problem and that I should get in touch with the manufacturer and that Amazon would do nothing and would not provide any assistance in getting product replaced.

amazon	Leo Terrell	2010-04-10T02:14:53Z	Everyone goes to the store to search for what they want and when it comes to online shopping it is very convenient. Amazon is a very well-known and great place to go online and shop for certain products. Although, Amazon is literally taking over the world and making businesses and companies out of business it is still the best online shopping place, because service can be extremely fast, there are lots of discounts on products, and the products are just very useful.My family has amazon prime and we can buy products and get them in two days. You even get discounts too, there was a product that my parents were gonna buy for $60, but with amazon prime the price went down to $20. Can you believe it? Although, many businesses and companies are going out of business, Amazon has everything you need at a good price and good shipping. Amazon is a very great place to shop and their products are always in good condition,  hopefully they never run out of business.	N/A, US	1 review	5

amazon	Eelasor, Idaho	2010-09-01T19:23:37Z	My experience with making purchases from Amazon has usually been a positive one.  However, in the event that a product I purchase is incorrect and the fault is from a third party seller, Amazon has often provided a refund or told me to keep the item.  There have also been times when experiencing certain issues regarding an item to be purchased, and  they have offered courtesy services such as free shipping or percentages off an item when applicable.For the most part, if someone search for good pricing deals they will find it here, especially for good used books and other good used products as well.

amazon	anthony genth	2010-07-14T11:19:41Z	"Amazon is too big and completely out of control! I placed an order with Amazon while traveling on business in the UK. When I went to Amazon all of my personal information including my credit cards were stored on the Amazon.co.uk site. When I tried to get a refund for the order that was not delivered they told me i have to call the UK as the companies are separate? When I asked them if the companies are separate how come the UK Amazon has all of my personal information? They told me that they share information with all Amazon companies but if there is a problem with an order then the client has to call Amazon in the country where the order was placed?!? I wonder what the GDPR authorities have to say about such a casual attitude to the GDPR privacy protection law? I also live in a an apartment with another family and although we have separate Amazon accounts and Prime accounts, Amazon regularly mixes up our orders and cross utilizes our credit cards?? I don't think that this is legal and when i complain to them it's ""well it's our policy""??? Terrible arrogant company."	N/A, US	4 reviews	1

amazon	dogtown23	2010-04-17T21:53:20Z	I have happily cut Amazon out of my life entirely.  I do not purchase anything for my business or home from them due to their  awful customer service when I was a paying Prime customer.  The csr's I have spoken to were not helpful and did not attempt to solve the two problems I have ever had to call about.   Both times I have called were about Amazon sold and fulfilled products that were faulty or defective and cost less than $20 each.   They only would say it was my problem and that I should get in touch with the manufacturer and that Amazon would do nothing and would not provide any assistance in getting product replaced.

amazon	Leo Terrell	2010-04-10T02:14:53Z	Everyone goes to the store to search for what they want and when it comes to online shopping it is very convenient. Amazon is a very well-known and great place to go online and shop for certain products. Although, Amazon is literally taking over the world and making businesses and companies out of business it is still the best online shopping place, because service can be extremely fast, there are lots of discounts on products, and the products are just very useful.My family has amazon prime and we can buy products and get them in two days. You even get discounts too, there was a product that my parents were gonna buy for $60, but with amazon prime the price went down to $20. Can you believe it? Although, many businesses and companies are going out of business, Amazon has everything you need at a good price and good shipping. Amazon is a very great place to shop and their products are always in good condition,  hopefully they never run out of business.	N/A, US	1 review	5

amazon	Mick	2010-11-04T13:38:52Z	"Two options: 1) Average prices, lousy service and China slow delivery. 2) Average prices, lousy service, expensive shipping membership, same shipping time that other retailers offer for free.Amazon non-Prime customers receive a lower standard of customer service. Also, Amazon intentionally inconveniences Non-Prime customers by delaying shipping for an unreasonable amount of time in an attempt to manipulate shoppers into buying Prime.Product prices are initially adjusted up to cover shipping, and then they want you to buy Prime in order to receive it in a reasonable amount of time. Prime two day delivery is nothing special, it's not offered on all products and often unreliable. I receive eBay and Walmart orders before Amazon. I placed three separate orders over a period of three days, only one showed ""shipped"" four days after placing the last order. It was the last order I placed that showed and It only shipped because I had attempted to cancel that order. The status just happened to change at the exact time I tried to cancel, so that I couldn't cancel. And, it sat in the warehouse for days after that.  Amazon may be a fair deal for customers who find enough value in the other services offered with Prime membership and shop enough to justify purchasing it. However, it is not a fair marketplace for the infrequent shopping non-Prime customer.Amazon no longer passes along savings to customers. Aside from initial pocketing, the company uses it's profits for huge advertising and massive expansion."	N/A, US	1 review	2

amazon	dogtown23	2010-04-17T21:53:20Z	I have happily cut Amazon out of my life entirely.  I do not purchase anything for my business or home from them due to their  awful customer service when I was a paying Prime customer.  The csr's I have spoken to were not helpful and did not attempt to solve the two problems I have ever had to call about.   Both times I have called were about Amazon sold and fulfilled products that were faulty or defective and cost less than $20 each.   They only would say it was my problem and that I should get in touch with the manufacturer and that Amazon would do nothing and would not provide any assistance in getting product replaced.

amazon	Leo Terrell	2010-04-10T02:14:53Z	Everyone goes to the store to search for what they want and when it comes to online shopping it is very convenient. Amazon is a very well-known and great place to go online and shop for certain products. Although, Amazon is literally taking over the world and making businesses and companies out of business it is still the best online shopping place, because service can be extremely fast, there are lots of discounts on products, and the products are just very useful.My family has amazon prime and we can buy products and get them in two days. You even get discounts too, there was a product that my parents were gonna buy for $60, but with amazon prime the price went down to $20. Can you believe it? Although, many businesses and companies are going out of business, Amazon has everything you need at a good price and good shipping. Amazon is a very great place to shop and their products are always in good condition,  hopefully they never run out of business.	N/A, US	1 review	5

Also, Amazon intentionally inconveniences Non-Prime customers by delaying shipping for an unreasonable amount of time in an attempt to manipulate shoppers into buying Prime.Product prices are initially adjusted up to cover shipping, and then they want you to buy Prime in order to receive it in a reasonable amount of time. Prime two day delivery is nothing special, it's not offered on all products and often unreliable. I receive eBay and Walmart orders before Amazon. I placed three separate orders over a period of three days, only one showed ""shipped"" four days after placing the last order. It was the last order I placed that showed and It only shipped because I had attempted to cancel that order. The status just happened to change at the exact time I tried to cancel, so that I couldn't cancel. And, it sat in the warehouse for days after that.  Amazon may be a fair deal for customers who find enough value in the other services offered with Prime membership and shop enough to justify purchasing it. However, it is not a fair marketplace for the infrequent shopping non-Prime customer.Amazon no longer passes along savings to customers. Aside from initial pocketing, the company uses it's profits for huge advertising and massive expansion."	N/A, US	1 review	2
amazon	Luther Tan	2010-11-03T12:15:51Z	I believe giving them 3 stars is a fair rating. My experiences with Amazon is similar to a love hate relationship. At times, the items I ordered gets delivered on time and in perfect condition which I am very grateful of. But other times, my items are either slightly damaged or late. I had to return them and it will take ages for the item to be sent back before a replacement arrives. Dilemma indeed!	N/A, MY	6 reviews	3

amazon	Eelasor, Idaho	2010-09-01T19:23:37Z	My experience with making purchases from Amazon has usually been a positive one.  However, in the event that a product I purchase is incorrect and the fault is from a third party seller, Amazon has often provided a refund or told me to keep the item.  There have also been times when experiencing certain issues regarding an item to be purchased, and  they have offered courtesy services such as free shipping or percentages off an item when applicable.For the most part, if someone search for good pricing deals they will find it here, especially for good used books and other good used products as well.

When I went to Amazon all of my personal information including my credit cards were stored on the Amazon.co.uk site. When I tried to get a refund for the order that was not delivered they told me i have to call the UK as the companies are separate? When I asked them if the companies are separate how come the UK Amazon has all of my personal information? They told me that they share information with all Amazon companies but if there is a problem with an order then the client has to call Amazon in the country where the order was placed?!? I wonder what the GDPR authorities have to say about such a casual attitude to the GDPR privacy protection law? I also live in a an apartment with another family and although we have separate Amazon accounts and Prime accounts, Amazon regularly mixes up our orders and cross utilizes our credit cards??

Also, Amazon intentionally inconveniences Non-Prime customers by delaying shipping for an unreasonable amount of time in an attempt to manipulate shoppers into buying Prime.Product prices are initially adjusted up to cover shipping, and then they want you to buy Prime in order to receive it in a reasonable amount of time. Prime two day delivery is nothing special, it's not offered on all products and often unreliable. I receive eBay and Walmart orders before Amazon. I placed three separate orders over a period of three days, only one showed ""shipped"" four days after placing the last order. It was the last order I placed that showed and It only shipped because I had attempted to cancel that order. The status just happened to change at the exact time I tried to cancel, so that I couldn't cancel. And, it sat in the warehouse for days after that.  Amazon may be a fair deal for customers who find enough value in the other services offered with Prime membership and shop enough to justify purchasing it. However, it is not a fair marketplace for the infrequent shopping non-Prime customer.Amazon no longer passes along savings to customers. Aside from initial pocketing, the company uses it's profits for huge advertising and massive expansion."	N/A, US	1 review	2
amazon	Luther Tan	2010-11-03T12:15:51Z	I believe giving them 3 stars is a fair rating. My experiences with Amazon is similar to a love hate relationship. At times, the items I ordered gets delivered on time and in perfect condition which I am very grateful of. But other times, my items are either slightly damaged or late. I had to return them and it will take ages for the item to be sent back before a replacement arrives. Dilemma indeed!	N/A, MY	6 reviews	3

amazon	Eelasor, Idaho	2010-09-01T19:23:37Z	My experience with making purchases from Amazon has usually been a positive one.  However, in the event that a product I purchase is incorrect and the fault is from a third party seller, Amazon has often provided a refund or told me to keep the item.  There have also been times when experiencing certain issues regarding an item to be purchased, and  they have offered courtesy services such as free shipping or percentages off an item when applicable.For the most part, if someone search for good pricing deals they will find it here, especially for good used books and other good used products as well.

When I went to Amazon all of my personal information including my credit cards were stored on the Amazon.co.uk site. When I tried to get a refund for the order that was not delivered they told me i have to call the UK as the companies are separate? When I asked them if the companies are separate how come the UK Amazon has all of my personal information? They told me that they share information with all Amazon companies but if there is a problem with an order then the client has to call Amazon in the country where the order was placed?!? I wonder what the GDPR authorities have to say about such a casual attitude to the GDPR privacy protection law? I also live in a an apartment with another family and although we have separate Amazon accounts and Prime accounts, Amazon regularly mixes up our orders and cross utilizes our credit cards?? I don't think that this is legal and when i complain to them it's ""well it's our policy""??? Terrible arrogant company."	N/A, US	4 reviews	1

I do not purchase anything for my business or home from them due to their  awful customer service when I was a paying Prime customer.  The csr's I have spoken to were not helpful and did not attempt to solve the two problems I have ever had to call about.   Both times I have called were about Amazon sold and fulfilled products that were faulty or defective and cost less than $20 each.   They only would say it was my problem and that I should get in touch with the manufacturer and that Amazon would do nothing and would not provide any assistance in getting product replaced.

amazon	Leo Terrell	2010-04-10T02:14:53Z	Everyone goes to the store to search for what they want and when it comes to online shopping it is very convenient. Amazon is a very well-known and great place to go online and shop for certain products. Although, Amazon is literally taking over the world and making businesses and companies out of business it is still the best online shopping place, because service can be extremely fast, there are lots of discounts on products, and the products are just very useful.My family has amazon prime and we can buy products and get them in two days. You even get discounts too, there was a product that my parents were gonna buy for $60, but with amazon prime the price went down to $20. Can you believe it? Although, many businesses and companies are going out of business, Amazon has everything you need at a good price and good shipping. Amazon is a very great place to shop and their products are always in good condition,  hopefully they never run out of business.	N/A, US	1 review	5

amazon	Eelasor, Idaho	2010-09-01T19:23:37Z	My experience with making purchases from Amazon has usually been a positive one.  However, in the event that a product I purchase is incorrect and the fault is from a third party seller, Amazon has often provided a refund or told me to keep the item.  There have also been times when experiencing certain issues regarding an item to be purchased, and  they have offered courtesy services such as free shipping or percentages off an item when applicable.For the most part, if someone search for good pricing deals they will find it here, especially for good used books and other good used products as well.

amazon	anthony genth	2010-07-14T11:19:41Z	"Amazon is too big and completely out of control! I placed an order with Amazon while traveling on business in the UK. When I went to Amazon all of my personal information including my credit cards were stored on the Amazon.co.uk site. When I tried to get a refund for the order that was not delivered they told me i have to call the UK as the companies are separate? When I asked them if the companies are separate how come the UK Amazon has all of my personal information? They told me that they share information with all Amazon companies but if there is a problem with an order then the client has to call Amazon in the country where the order was placed?!? I wonder what the GDPR authorities have to say about such a casual attitude to the GDPR privacy protection law? I also live in a an apartment with another family and although we have separate Amazon accounts and Prime accounts, Amazon regularly mixes up our orders and cross utilizes our credit cards?? I don't think that this is legal and when i complain to them it's ""well it's our policy""??? Terrible arrogant company."	N/A, US	4 reviews	1

amazon	dogtown23	2010-04-17T21:53:20Z	I have happily cut Amazon out of my life entirely.  I do not purchase anything for my business or home from them due to their  awful customer service when I was a paying Prime customer.  The csr's I have spoken to were not helpful and did not attempt to solve the two problems I have ever had to call about.   Both times I have called were about Amazon sold and fulfilled products that were faulty or defective and cost less than $20 each.   They only would say it was my problem and that I should get in touch with the manufacturer and that Amazon would do nothing and would not provide any assistance in getting product replaced.

amazon	Leo Terrell	2010-04-10T02:14:53Z	Everyone goes to the store to search for what they want and when it comes to online shopping it is very convenient. Amazon is a very well-known and great place to go online and shop for certain products. Although, Amazon is literally taking over the world and making businesses and companies out of business it is still the best online shopping place, because service can be extremely fast, there are lots of discounts on products, and the products are just very useful.My family has amazon prime and we can buy products and get them in two days. You even get discounts too, there was a product that my parents were gonna buy for $60, but with amazon prime the price went down to $20. Can you believe it? Although, many businesses and companies are going out of business, Amazon has everything you need at a good price and good shipping. Amazon is a very great place to shop and their products are always in good condition,  hopefully they never run out of business.	N/A, US	1 review	5

Also, Amazon intentionally inconveniences Non-Prime customers by delaying shipping for an unreasonable amount of time in an attempt to manipulate shoppers into buying Prime.Product prices are initially adjusted up to cover shipping, and then they want you to buy Prime in order to receive it in a reasonable amount of time. Prime two day delivery is nothing special, it's not offered on all products and often unreliable. I receive eBay and Walmart orders before Amazon. I placed three separate orders over a period of three days, only one showed ""shipped"" four days after placing the last order. It was the last order I placed that showed and It only shipped because I had attempted to cancel that order. The status just happened to change at the exact time I tried to cancel, so that I couldn't cancel. And, it sat in the warehouse for days after that.  Amazon may be a fair deal for customers who find enough value in the other services offered with Prime membership and shop enough to justify purchasing it. However, it is not a fair marketplace for the infrequent shopping non-Prime customer.Amazon no longer passes along savings to customers. Aside from initial pocketing, the company uses it's profits for huge advertising and massive expansion."	N/A, US	1 review	2

There have also been times when experiencing certain issues regarding an item to be purchased, and  they have offered courtesy services such as free shipping or percentages off an item when applicable.For the most part, if someone search for good pricing deals they will find it here, especially for good used books and other good used products as well.

amazon	anthony genth	2010-07-14T11:19:41Z	"Amazon is too big and completely out of control! I placed an order with Amazon while traveling on business in the UK. When I went to Amazon all of my personal information including my credit cards were stored on the Amazon.co.uk site. When I tried to get a refund for the order that was not delivered they told me i have to call the UK as the companies are separate? When I asked them if the companies are separate how come the UK Amazon has all of my personal information? They told me that they share information with all Amazon companies but if there is a problem with an order then the client has to call Amazon in the country where the order was placed?!? I wonder what the GDPR authorities have to say about such a casual attitude to the GDPR privacy protection law? I also live in a an apartment with another family and although we have separate Amazon accounts and Prime accounts, Amazon regularly mixes up our orders and cross utilizes our credit cards?? I don't think that this is legal and when i complain to them it's ""well it's our policy""??? Terrible arrogant company."	N/A, US	4 reviews	1

amazon	dogtown23	2010-04-17T21:53:20Z	I have happily cut Amazon out of my life entirely.  I do not purchase anything for my business or home from them due to their  awful customer service when I was a paying Prime customer.  The csr's I have spoken to were not helpful and did not attempt to solve the two problems I have ever had to call about.   Both times I have called were about Amazon sold and fulfilled products that were faulty or defective and cost less than $20 each.   They only would say it was my problem and that I should get in touch with the manufacturer and that Amazon would do nothing and would not provide any assistance in getting product replaced.

amazon	Leo Terrell	2010-04-10T02:14:53Z	Everyone goes to the store to search for what they want and when it comes to online shopping it is very convenient. Amazon is a very well-known and great place to go online and shop for certain products. Although, Amazon is literally taking over the world and making businesses and companies out of business it is still the best online shopping place, because service can be extremely fast, there are lots of discounts on products, and the products are just very useful.My family has amazon prime and we can buy products and get them in two days. You even get discounts too, there was a product that my parents were gonna buy for $60, but with amazon prime the price went down to $20. Can you believe it? Although, many businesses and companies are going out of business, Amazon has everything you need at a good price and good shipping. Amazon is a very great place to shop and their products are always in good condition,  hopefully they never run out of business.	N/A, US	1 review	5

amazon	Mick	2010-11-04T13:38:52Z	"Two options: 1) Average prices, lousy service and China slow delivery. 2) Average prices, lousy service, expensive shipping membership, same shipping time that other retailers offer for free.Amazon non-Prime customers receive a lower standard of customer service. Also, Amazon intentionally inconveniences Non-Prime customers by delaying shipping for an unreasonable amount of time in an attempt to manipulate shoppers into buying Prime.Product prices are initially adjusted up to cover shipping, and then they want you to buy Prime in order to receive it in a reasonable amount of time. Prime two day delivery is nothing special, it's not offered on all products and often unreliable. I receive eBay and Walmart orders before Amazon. I placed three separate orders over a period of three days, only one showed ""shipped"" four days after placing the last order. It was the last order I placed that showed and It only shipped because I had attempted to cancel that order. The status just happened to change at the exact time I tried to cancel, so that I couldn't cancel. And, it sat in the warehouse for days after that.  Amazon may be a fair deal for customers who find enough value in the other services offered with Prime membership and shop enough to justify purchasing it. However, it is not a fair marketplace for the infrequent shopping non-Prime customer.Amazon no longer passes along savings to customers. Aside from initial pocketing, the company uses it's profits for huge advertising and massive expansion."	N/A, US	1 review	2

amazon	Leo Terrell	2010-04-10T02:14:53Z	Everyone goes to the store to search for what they want and when it comes to online shopping it is very convenient. Amazon is a very well-known and great place to go online and shop for certain products. Although, Amazon is literally taking over the world and making businesses and companies out of business it is still the best online shopping place, because service can be extremely fast, there are lots of discounts on products, and the products are just very useful.My family has amazon prime and we can buy products and get them in two days. You even get discounts too, there was a product that my parents were gonna buy for $60, but with amazon prime the price went down to $20. Can you believe it? Although, many businesses and companies are going out of business, Amazon has everything you need at a good price and good shipping. Amazon is a very great place to shop and their products are always in good condition,  hopefully they never run out of business.	N/A, US	1 review	5

Also, Amazon intentionally inconveniences Non-Prime customers by delaying shipping for an unreasonable amount of time in an attempt to manipulate shoppers into buying Prime.Product prices are initially adjusted up to cover shipping, and then they want you to buy Prime in order to receive it in a reasonable amount of time. Prime two day delivery is nothing special, it's not offered on all products and often unreliable. I receive eBay and Walmart orders before Amazon. I placed three separate orders over a period of three days, only one showed ""shipped"" four days after placing the last order. It was the last order I placed that showed and It only shipped because I had attempted to cancel that order. The status just happened to change at the exact time I tried to cancel, so that I couldn't cancel. And, it sat in the warehouse for days after that.  Amazon may be a fair deal for customers who find enough value in the other services offered with Prime membership and shop enough to justify purchasing it. However, it is not a fair marketplace for the infrequent shopping non-Prime customer.Amazon no longer passes along savings to customers. Aside from initial pocketing, the company uses it's profits for huge advertising and massive expansion."	N/A, US	1 review	2

At times, the items I ordered gets delivered on time and in perfect condition which I am very grateful of. But other times, my items are either slightly damaged or late.

amazon	Eelasor, Idaho	2010-09-01T19:23:37Z	My experience with making purchases from Amazon has usually been a positive one.  However, in the event that a product I purchase is incorrect and the fault is from a third party seller, Amazon has often provided a refund or told me to keep the item.  There have also been times when experiencing certain issues regarding an item to be purchased, and  they have offered courtesy services such as free shipping or percentages off an item when applicable.For the most part, if someone search for good pricing deals they will find it here, especially for good used books and other good used products as well.

When I went to Amazon all of my personal information including my credit cards were stored on the Amazon.co.uk site.

When I asked them if the companies are separate how come the UK Amazon has all of my personal information? They told me that they share information with all Amazon companies but if there is a problem with an order then the client has to call Amazon in the country where the order was placed?!?

I also live in a an apartment with another family and although we have separate Amazon accounts and Prime accounts, Amazon regularly mixes up our orders and cross utilizes our credit cards??

amazon	Luther Tan	2010-11-03T12:15:51Z	I believe giving them 3 stars is a fair rating. My experiences with Amazon is similar to a love hate relationship. At times, the items I ordered gets delivered on time and in perfect condition which I am very grateful of. But other times, my items are either slightly damaged or late. I had to return them and it will take ages for the item to be sent back before a replacement arrives. Dilemma indeed!	N/A, MY	6 reviews	3

amazon	Eelasor, Idaho	2010-09-01T19:23:37Z	My experience with making purchases from Amazon has usually been a positive one.  However, in the event that a product I purchase is incorrect and the fault is from a third party seller, Amazon has often provided a refund or told me to keep the item.  There have also been times when experiencing certain issues regarding an item to be purchased, and  they have offered courtesy services such as free shipping or percentages off an item when applicable.For the most part, if someone search for good pricing deals they will find it here, especially for good used books and other good used products as well.

When I went to Amazon all of my personal information including my credit cards were stored on the Amazon.co.uk site. When I tried to get a refund for the order that was not delivered they told me i have to call the UK as the companies are separate? When I asked them if the companies are separate how come the UK Amazon has all of my personal information? They told me that they share information with all Amazon companies but if there is a problem with an order then the client has to call Amazon in the country where the order was placed?!? I wonder what the GDPR authorities have to say about such a casual attitude to the GDPR privacy protection law? I also live in a an apartment with another family and although we have separate Amazon accounts and Prime accounts, Amazon regularly mixes up our orders and cross utilizes our credit cards?? I don't think that this is legal and when i complain to them it's ""well it's our policy""??? Terrible arrogant company."	N/A, US	4 reviews	1

amazon	dogtown23	2010-04-17T21:53:20Z	I have happily cut Amazon out of my life entirely.  I do not purchase anything for my business or home from them due to their  awful customer service when I was a paying Prime customer.  The csr's I have spoken to were not helpful and did not attempt to solve the two problems I have ever had to call about.   Both times I have called were about Amazon sold and fulfilled products that were faulty or defective and cost less than $20 each.   They only would say it was my problem and that I should get in touch with the manufacturer and that Amazon would do nothing and would not provide any assistance in getting product replaced.

amazon	Leo Terrell	2010-04-10T02:14:53Z	Everyone goes to the store to search for what they want and when it comes to online shopping it is very convenient. Amazon is a very well-known and great place to go online and shop for certain products. Although, Amazon is literally taking over the world and making businesses and companies out of business it is still the best online shopping place, because service can be extremely fast, there are lots of discounts on products, and the products are just very useful.My family has amazon prime and we can buy products and get them in two days. You even get discounts too, there was a product that my parents were gonna buy for $60, but with amazon prime the price went down to $20. Can you believe it? Although, many businesses and companies are going out of business, Amazon has everything you need at a good price and good shipping. Amazon is a very great place to shop and their products are always in good condition,  hopefully they never run out of business.	N/A, US	1 review	5

amazon	Eelasor, Idaho	2010-09-01T19:23:37Z	My experience with making purchases from Amazon has usually been a positive one.  However, in the event that a product I purchase is incorrect and the fault is from a third party seller, Amazon has often provided a refund or told me to keep the item.  There have also been times when experiencing certain issues regarding an item to be purchased, and  they have offered courtesy services such as free shipping or percentages off an item when applicable.For the most part, if someone search for good pricing deals they will find it here, especially for good used books and other good used products as well.

amazon	anthony genth	2010-07-14T11:19:41Z	"Amazon is too big and completely out of control! I placed an order with Amazon while traveling on business in the UK. When I went to Amazon all of my personal information including my credit cards were stored on the Amazon.co.uk site. When I tried to get a refund for the order that was not delivered they told me i have to call the UK as the companies are separate? When I asked them if the companies are separate how come the UK Amazon has all of my personal information? They told me that they share information with all Amazon companies but if there is a problem with an order then the client has to call Amazon in the country where the order was placed?!? I wonder what the GDPR authorities have to say about such a casual attitude to the GDPR privacy protection law? I also live in a an apartment with another family and although we have separate Amazon accounts and Prime accounts, Amazon regularly mixes up our orders and cross utilizes our credit cards?? I don't think that this is legal and when i complain to them it's ""well it's our policy""??? Terrible arrogant company."	N/A, US	4 reviews	1

amazon	dogtown23	2010-04-17T21:53:20Z	I have happily cut Amazon out of my life entirely.  I do not purchase anything for my business or home from them due to their  awful customer service when I was a paying Prime customer.  The csr's I have spoken to were not helpful and did not attempt to solve the two problems I have ever had to call about.   Both times I have called were about Amazon sold and fulfilled products that were faulty or defective and cost less than $20 each.   They only would say it was my problem and that I should get in touch with the manufacturer and that Amazon would do nothing and would not provide any assistance in getting product replaced.

amazon	Leo Terrell	2010-04-10T02:14:53Z	Everyone goes to the store to search for what they want and when it comes to online shopping it is very convenient. Amazon is a very well-known and great place to go online and shop for certain products. Although, Amazon is literally taking over the world and making businesses and companies out of business it is still the best online shopping place, because service can be extremely fast, there are lots of discounts on products, and the products are just very useful.My family has amazon prime and we can buy products and get them in two days. You even get discounts too, there was a product that my parents were gonna buy for $60, but with amazon prime the price went down to $20. Can you believe it? Although, many businesses and companies are going out of business, Amazon has everything you need at a good price and good shipping. Amazon is a very great place to shop and their products are always in good condition,  hopefully they never run out of business.	N/A, US	1 review	5

amazon	Mick	2010-11-04T13:38:52Z	"Two options: 1) Average prices, lousy service and China slow delivery. 2) Average prices, lousy service, expensive shipping membership, same shipping time that other retailers offer for free.Amazon non-Prime customers receive a lower standard of customer service. Also, Amazon intentionally inconveniences Non-Prime customers by delaying shipping for an unreasonable amount of time in an attempt to manipulate shoppers into buying Prime.Product prices are initially adjusted up to cover shipping, and then they want you to buy Prime in order to receive it in a reasonable amount of time. Prime two day delivery is nothing special, it's not offered on all products and often unreliable. I receive eBay and Walmart orders before Amazon. I placed three separate orders over a period of three days, only one showed ""shipped"" four days after placing the last order. It was the last order I placed that showed and It only shipped because I had attempted to cancel that order. The status just happened to change at the exact time I tried to cancel, so that I couldn't cancel. And, it sat in the warehouse for days after that.  Amazon may be a fair deal for customers who find enough value in the other services offered with Prime membership and shop enough to justify purchasing it. However, it is not a fair marketplace for the infrequent shopping non-Prime customer.Amazon no longer passes along savings to customers. Aside from initial pocketing, the company uses it's profits for huge advertising and massive expansion."	N/A, US	1 review	2

amazon	dogtown23	2010-04-17T21:53:20Z	I have happily cut Amazon out of my life entirely.  I do not purchase anything for my business or home from them due to their  awful customer service when I was a paying Prime customer.  The csr's I have spoken to were not helpful and did not attempt to solve the two problems I have ever had to call about.   Both times I have called were about Amazon sold and fulfilled products that were faulty or defective and cost less than $20 each.   They only would say it was my problem and that I should get in touch with the manufacturer and that Amazon would do nothing and would not provide any assistance in getting product replaced.

amazon	Leo Terrell	2010-04-10T02:14:53Z	Everyone goes to the store to search for what they want and when it comes to online shopping it is very convenient. Amazon is a very well-known and great place to go online and shop for certain products. Although, Amazon is literally taking over the world and making businesses and companies out of business it is still the best online shopping place, because service can be extremely fast, there are lots of discounts on products, and the products are just very useful.My family has amazon prime and we can buy products and get them in two days. You even get discounts too, there was a product that my parents were gonna buy for $60, but with amazon prime the price went down to $20. Can you believe it? Although, many businesses and companies are going out of business, Amazon has everything you need at a good price and good shipping. Amazon is a very great place to shop and their products are always in good condition,  hopefully they never run out of business.	N/A, US	1 review	5

Also, Amazon intentionally inconveniences Non-Prime customers by delaying shipping for an unreasonable amount of time in an attempt to manipulate shoppers into buying Prime.Product prices are initially adjusted up to cover shipping, and then they want you to buy Prime in order to receive it in a reasonable amount of time. Prime two day delivery is nothing special, it's not offered on all products and often unreliable. I receive eBay and Walmart orders before Amazon. I placed three separate orders over a period of three days, only one showed ""shipped"" four days after placing the last order. It was the last order I placed that showed and It only shipped because I had attempted to cancel that order. The status just happened to change at the exact time I tried to cancel, so that I couldn't cancel. And, it sat in the warehouse for days after that.  Amazon may be a fair deal for customers who find enough value in the other services offered with Prime membership and shop enough to justify purchasing it. However, it is not a fair marketplace for the infrequent shopping non-Prime customer.Amazon no longer passes along savings to customers. Aside from initial pocketing, the company uses it's profits for huge advertising and massive expansion."	N/A, US	1 review	2
amazon	Luther Tan	2010-11-03T12:15:51Z	I believe giving them 3 stars is a fair rating. My experiences with Amazon is similar to a love hate relationship. At times, the items I ordered gets delivered on time and in perfect condition which I am very grateful of. But other times, my items are either slightly damaged or late. I had to return them and it will take ages for the item to be sent back before a replacement arrives. Dilemma indeed!	N/A, MY	6 reviews	3

amazon	Eelasor, Idaho	2010-09-01T19:23:37Z	My experience with making purchases from Amazon has usually been a positive one.  However, in the event that a product I purchase is incorrect and the fault is from a third party seller, Amazon has often provided a refund or told me to keep the item.  There have also been times when experiencing certain issues regarding an item to be purchased, and  they have offered courtesy services such as free shipping or percentages off an item when applicable.For the most part, if someone search for good pricing deals they will find it here, especially for good used books and other good used products as well.

When I went to Amazon all of my personal information including my credit cards were stored on the Amazon.co.uk site. When I tried to get a refund for the order that was not delivered they told me i have to call the UK as the companies are separate? When I asked them if the companies are separate how come the UK Amazon has all of my personal information? They told me that they share information with all Amazon companies but if there is a problem with an order then the client has to call Amazon in the country where the order was placed?!? I wonder what the GDPR authorities have to say about such a casual attitude to the GDPR privacy protection law? I also live in a an apartment with another family and although we have separate Amazon accounts and Prime accounts, Amazon regularly mixes up our orders and cross utilizes our credit cards??

Also, Amazon intentionally inconveniences Non-Prime customers by delaying shipping for an unreasonable amount of time in an attempt to manipulate shoppers into buying Prime.Product prices are initially adjusted up to cover shipping, and then they want you to buy Prime in order to receive it in a reasonable amount of time. Prime two day delivery is nothing special, it's not offered on all products and often unreliable. I receive eBay and Walmart orders before Amazon. I placed three separate orders over a period of three days, only one showed ""shipped"" four days after placing the last order. It was the last order I placed that showed and It only shipped because I had attempted to cancel that order. The status just happened to change at the exact time I tried to cancel, so that I couldn't cancel. And, it sat in the warehouse for days after that.  Amazon may be a fair deal for customers who find enough value in the other services offered with Prime membership and shop enough to justify purchasing it. However, it is not a fair marketplace for the infrequent shopping non-Prime customer.Amazon no longer passes along savings to customers. Aside from initial pocketing, the company uses it's profits for huge advertising and massive expansion."	N/A, US	1 review	2
amazon	Luther Tan	2010-11-03T12:15:51Z	I believe giving them 3 stars is a fair rating. My experiences with Amazon is similar to a love hate relationship. At times, the items I ordered gets delivered on time and in perfect condition which I am very grateful of. But other times, my items are either slightly damaged or late. I had to return them and it will take ages for the item to be sent back before a replacement arrives. Dilemma indeed!	N/A, MY	6 reviews	3

amazon	Eelasor, Idaho	2010-09-01T19:23:37Z	My experience with making purchases from Amazon has usually been a positive one.  However, in the event that a product I purchase is incorrect and the fault is from a third party seller, Amazon has often provided a refund or told me to keep the item.  There have also been times when experiencing certain issues regarding an item to be purchased, and  they have offered courtesy services such as free shipping or percentages off an item when applicable.For the most part, if someone search for good pricing deals they will find it here, especially for good used books and other good used products as well.

When I went to Amazon all of my personal information including my credit cards were stored on the Amazon.co.uk site. When I tried to get a refund for the order that was not delivered they told me i have to call the UK as the companies are separate? When I asked them if the companies are separate how come the UK Amazon has all of my personal information? They told me that they share information with all Amazon companies but if there is a problem with an order then the client has to call Amazon in the country where the order was placed?!? I wonder what the GDPR authorities have to say about such a casual attitude to the GDPR privacy protection law? I also live in a an apartment with another family and although we have separate Amazon accounts and Prime accounts, Amazon regularly mixes up our orders and cross utilizes our credit cards?? I don't think that this is legal and when i complain to them it's ""well it's our policy""??? Terrible arrogant company."	N/A, US	4 reviews	1

I do not purchase anything for my business or home from them due to their  awful customer service when I was a paying Prime customer.  The csr's I have spoken to were not helpful and did not attempt to solve the two problems I have ever had to call about.   Both times I have called were about Amazon sold and fulfilled products that were faulty or defective and cost less than $20 each.   They only would say it was my problem and that I should get in touch with the manufacturer and that Amazon would do nothing and would not provide any assistance in getting product replaced.

amazon	Leo Terrell	2010-04-10T02:14:53Z	Everyone goes to the store to search for what they want and when it comes to online shopping it is very convenient. Amazon is a very well-known and great place to go online and shop for certain products. Although, Amazon is literally taking over the world and making businesses and companies out of business it is still the best online shopping place, because service can be extremely fast, there are lots of discounts on products, and the products are just very useful.My family has amazon prime and we can buy products and get them in two days. You even get discounts too, there was a product that my parents were gonna buy for $60, but with amazon prime the price went down to $20. Can you believe it? Although, many businesses and companies are going out of business, Amazon has everything you need at a good price and good shipping. Amazon is a very great place to shop and their products are always in good condition,  hopefully they never run out of business.	N/A, US	1 review	5

amazon	Eelasor, Idaho	2010-09-01T19:23:37Z	My experience with making purchases from Amazon has usually been a positive one.  However, in the event that a product I purchase is incorrect and the fault is from a third party seller, Amazon has often provided a refund or told me to keep the item.  There have also been times when experiencing certain issues regarding an item to be purchased, and  they have offered courtesy services such as free shipping or percentages off an item when applicable.For the most part, if someone search for good pricing deals they will find it here, especially for good used books and other good used products as well.

amazon	anthony genth	2010-07-14T11:19:41Z	"Amazon is too big and completely out of control! I placed an order with Amazon while traveling on business in the UK. When I went to Amazon all of my personal information including my credit cards were stored on the Amazon.co.uk site. When I tried to get a refund for the order that was not delivered they told me i have to call the UK as the companies are separate? When I asked them if the companies are separate how come the UK Amazon has all of my personal information? They told me that they share information with all Amazon companies but if there is a problem with an order then the client has to call Amazon in the country where the order was placed?!? I wonder what the GDPR authorities have to say about such a casual attitude to the GDPR privacy protection law? I also live in a an apartment with another family and although we have separate Amazon accounts and Prime accounts, Amazon regularly mixes up our orders and cross utilizes our credit cards?? I don't think that this is legal and when i complain to them it's ""well it's our policy""??? Terrible arrogant company."	N/A, US	4 reviews	1

amazon	dogtown23	2010-04-17T21:53:20Z	I have happily cut Amazon out of my life entirely.  I do not purchase anything for my business or home from them due to their  awful customer service when I was a paying Prime customer.  The csr's I have spoken to were not helpful and did not attempt to solve the two problems I have ever had to call about.   Both times I have called were about Amazon sold and fulfilled products that were faulty or defective and cost less than $20 each.   They only would say it was my problem and that I should get in touch with the manufacturer and that Amazon would do nothing and would not provide any assistance in getting product replaced.

amazon	Leo Terrell	2010-04-10T02:14:53Z	Everyone goes to the store to search for what they want and when it comes to online shopping it is very convenient. Amazon is a very well-known and great place to go online and shop for certain products. Although, Amazon is literally taking over the world and making businesses and companies out of business it is still the best online shopping place, because service can be extremely fast, there are lots of discounts on products, and the products are just very useful.My family has amazon prime and we can buy products and get them in two days. You even get discounts too, there was a product that my parents were gonna buy for $60, but with amazon prime the price went down to $20. Can you believe it? Although, many businesses and companies are going out of business, Amazon has everything you need at a good price and good shipping. Amazon is a very great place to shop and their products are always in good condition,  hopefully they never run out of business.	N/A, US	1 review	5

Also, Amazon intentionally inconveniences Non-Prime customers by delaying shipping for an unreasonable amount of time in an attempt to manipulate shoppers into buying Prime.Product prices are initially adjusted up to cover shipping, and then they want you to buy Prime in order to receive it in a reasonable amount of time. Prime two day delivery is nothing special, it's not offered on all products and often unreliable. I receive eBay and Walmart orders before Amazon. I placed three separate orders over a period of three days, only one showed ""shipped"" four days after placing the last order. It was the last order I placed that showed and It only shipped because I had attempted to cancel that order. The status just happened to change at the exact time I tried to cancel, so that I couldn't cancel. And, it sat in the warehouse for days after that.  Amazon may be a fair deal for customers who find enough value in the other services offered with Prime membership and shop enough to justify purchasing it. However, it is not a fair marketplace for the infrequent shopping non-Prime customer.Amazon no longer passes along savings to customers. Aside from initial pocketing, the company uses it's profits for huge advertising and massive expansion."	N/A, US	1 review	2

There have also been times when experiencing certain issues regarding an item to be purchased, and  they have offered courtesy services such as free shipping or percentages off an item when applicable.For the most part, if someone search for good pricing deals they will find it here, especially for good used books and other good used products as well.

amazon	anthony genth	2010-07-14T11:19:41Z	"Amazon is too big and completely out of control! I placed an order with Amazon while traveling on business in the UK. When I went to Amazon all of my personal information including my credit cards were stored on the Amazon.co.uk site. When I tried to get a refund for the order that was not delivered they told me i have to call the UK as the companies are separate? When I asked them if the companies are separate how come the UK Amazon has all of my personal information? They told me that they share information with all Amazon companies but if there is a problem with an order then the client has to call Amazon in the country where the order was placed?!? I wonder what the GDPR authorities have to say about such a casual attitude to the GDPR privacy protection law? I also live in a an apartment with another family and although we have separate Amazon accounts and Prime accounts, Amazon regularly mixes up our orders and cross utilizes our credit cards?? I don't think that this is legal and when i complain to them it's ""well it's our policy""??? Terrible arrogant company."	N/A, US	4 reviews	1

amazon	dogtown23	2010-04-17T21:53:20Z	I have happily cut Amazon out of my life entirely.  I do not purchase anything for my business or home from them due to their  awful customer service when I was a paying Prime customer.  The csr's I have spoken to were not helpful and did not attempt to solve the two problems I have ever had to call about.   Both times I have called were about Amazon sold and fulfilled products that were faulty or defective and cost less than $20 each.   They only would say it was my problem and that I should get in touch with the manufacturer and that Amazon would do nothing and would not provide any assistance in getting product replaced.

amazon	Leo Terrell	2010-04-10T02:14:53Z	Everyone goes to the store to search for what they want and when it comes to online shopping it is very convenient. Amazon is a very well-known and great place to go online and shop for certain products. Although, Amazon is literally taking over the world and making businesses and companies out of business it is still the best online shopping place, because service can be extremely fast, there are lots of discounts on products, and the products are just very useful.My family has amazon prime and we can buy products and get them in two days. You even get discounts too, there was a product that my parents were gonna buy for $60, but with amazon prime the price went down to $20. Can you believe it? Although, many businesses and companies are going out of business, Amazon has everything you need at a good price and good shipping. Amazon is a very great place to shop and their products are always in good condition,  hopefully they never run out of business.	N/A, US	1 review	5

amazon	Mick	2010-11-04T13:38:52Z	"Two options: 1) Average prices, lousy service and China slow delivery. 2) Average prices, lousy service, expensive shipping membership, same shipping time that other retailers offer for free.Amazon non-Prime customers receive a lower standard of customer service. Also, Amazon intentionally inconveniences Non-Prime customers by delaying shipping for an unreasonable amount of time in an attempt to manipulate shoppers into buying Prime.Product prices are initially adjusted up to cover shipping, and then they want you to buy Prime in order to receive it in a reasonable amount of time. Prime two day delivery is nothing special, it's not offered on all products and often unreliable. I receive eBay and Walmart orders before Amazon. I placed three separate orders over a period of three days, only one showed ""shipped"" four days after placing the last order. It was the last order I placed that showed and It only shipped because I had attempted to cancel that order. The status just happened to change at the exact time I tried to cancel, so that I couldn't cancel. And, it sat in the warehouse for days after that.  Amazon may be a fair deal for customers who find enough value in the other services offered with Prime membership and shop enough to justify purchasing it. However, it is not a fair marketplace for the infrequent shopping non-Prime customer.Amazon no longer passes along savings to customers. Aside from initial pocketing, the company uses it's profits for huge advertising and massive expansion."	N/A, US	1 review	2

amazon	Leo Terrell	2010-04-10T02:14:53Z	Everyone goes to the store to search for what they want and when it comes to online shopping it is very convenient. Amazon is a very well-known and great place to go online and shop for certain products. Although, Amazon is literally taking over the world and making businesses and companies out of business it is still the best online shopping place, because service can be extremely fast, there are lots of discounts on products, and the products are just very useful.My family has amazon prime and we can buy products and get them in two days. You even get discounts too, there was a product that my parents were gonna buy for $60, but with amazon prime the price went down to $20. Can you believe it? Although, many businesses and companies are going out of business, Amazon has everything you need at a good price and good shipping. Amazon is a very great place to shop and their products are always in good condition,  hopefully they never run out of business.	N/A, US	1 review	5

Also, Amazon intentionally inconveniences Non-Prime customers by delaying shipping for an unreasonable amount of time in an attempt to manipulate shoppers into buying Prime.Product prices are initially adjusted up to cover shipping, and then they want you to buy Prime in order to receive it in a reasonable amount of time. Prime two day delivery is nothing special, it's not offered on all products and often unreliable. I receive eBay and Walmart orders before Amazon. I placed three separate orders over a period of three days, only one showed ""shipped"" four days after placing the last order. It was the last order I placed that showed and It only shipped because I had attempted to cancel that order. The status just happened to change at the exact time I tried to cancel, so that I couldn't cancel. And, it sat in the warehouse for days after that.  Amazon may be a fair deal for customers who find enough value in the other services offered with Prime membership and shop enough to justify purchasing it. However, it is not a fair marketplace for the infrequent shopping non-Prime customer.Amazon no longer passes along savings to customers. Aside from initial pocketing, the company uses it's profits for huge advertising and massive expansion."	N/A, US	1 review	2

At times, the items I ordered gets delivered on time and in perfect condition which I am very grateful of. But other times, my items are either slightly damaged or late.

amazon	Eelasor, Idaho	2010-09-01T19:23:37Z	My experience with making purchases from Amazon has usually been a positive one.  However, in the event that a product I purchase is incorrect and the fault is from a third party seller, Amazon has often provided a refund or told me to keep the item.  There have also been times when experiencing certain issues regarding an item to be purchased, and  they have offered courtesy services such as free shipping or percentages off an item when applicable.For the most part, if someone search for good pricing deals they will find it here, especially for good used books and other good used products as well.

When I went to Amazon all of my personal information including my credit cards were stored on the Amazon.co.uk site.

When I asked them if the companies are separate how come the UK Amazon has all of my personal information? They told me that they share information with all Amazon companies but if there is a problem with an order then the client has to call Amazon in the country where the order was placed?!?

I also live in a an apartment with another family and although we have separate Amazon accounts and Prime accounts, Amazon regularly mixes up our orders and cross utilizes our credit cards??

amazon	Luther Tan	2010-11-03T12:15:51Z	I believe giving them 3 stars is a fair rating. My experiences with Amazon is similar to a love hate relationship. At times, the items I ordered gets delivered on time and in perfect condition which I am very grateful of. But other times, my items are either slightly damaged or late. I had to return them and it will take ages for the item to be sent back before a replacement arrives. Dilemma indeed!	N/A, MY	6 reviews	3

amazon	Eelasor, Idaho	2010-09-01T19:23:37Z	My experience with making purchases from Amazon has usually been a positive one.  However, in the event that a product I purchase is incorrect and the fault is from a third party seller, Amazon has often provided a refund or told me to keep the item.  There have also been times when experiencing certain issues regarding an item to be purchased, and  they have offered courtesy services such as free shipping or percentages off an item when applicable.For the most part, if someone search for good pricing deals they will find it here, especially for good used books and other good used products as well.

When I went to Amazon all of my personal information including my credit cards were stored on the Amazon.co.uk site. When I tried to get a refund for the order that was not delivered they told me i have to call the UK as the companies are separate? When I asked them if the companies are separate how come the UK Amazon has all of my personal information? They told me that they share information with all Amazon companies but if there is a problem with an order then the client has to call Amazon in the country where the order was placed?!? I wonder what the GDPR authorities have to say about such a casual attitude to the GDPR privacy protection law? I also live in a an apartment with another family and although we have separate Amazon accounts and Prime accounts, Amazon regularly mixes up our orders and cross utilizes our credit cards?? I don't think that this is legal and when i complain to them it's ""well it's our policy""??? Terrible arrogant company."	N/A, US	4 reviews	1

amazon	dogtown23	2010-04-17T21:53:20Z	I have happily cut Amazon out of my life entirely.  I do not purchase anything for my business or home from them due to their  awful customer service when I was a paying Prime customer.  The csr's I have spoken to were not helpful and did not attempt to solve the two problems I have ever had to call about.   Both times I have called were about Amazon sold and fulfilled products that were faulty or defective and cost less than $20 each.   They only would say it was my problem and that I should get in touch with the manufacturer and that Amazon would do nothing and would not provide any assistance in getting product replaced.

amazon	Leo Terrell	2010-04-10T02:14:53Z	Everyone goes to the store to search for what they want and when it comes to online shopping it is very convenient. Amazon is a very well-known and great place to go online and shop for certain products. Although, Amazon is literally taking over the world and making businesses and companies out of business it is still the best online shopping place, because service can be extremely fast, there are lots of discounts on products, and the products are just very useful.My family has amazon prime and we can buy products and get them in two days. You even get discounts too, there was a product that my parents were gonna buy for $60, but with amazon prime the price went down to $20. Can you believe it? Although, many businesses and companies are going out of business, Amazon has everything you need at a good price and good shipping. Amazon is a very great place to shop and their products are always in good condition,  hopefully they never run out of business.	N/A, US	1 review	5

amazon	Eelasor, Idaho	2010-09-01T19:23:37Z	My experience with making purchases from Amazon has usually been a positive one.  However, in the event that a product I purchase is incorrect and the fault is from a third party seller, Amazon has often provided a refund or told me to keep the item.  There have also been times when experiencing certain issues regarding an item to be purchased, and  they have offered courtesy services such as free shipping or percentages off an item when applicable.For the most part, if someone search for good pricing deals they will find it here, especially for good used books and other good used products as well.

amazon	anthony genth	2010-07-14T11:19:41Z	"Amazon is too big and completely out of control! I placed an order with Amazon while traveling on business in the UK. When I went to Amazon all of my personal information including my credit cards were stored on the Amazon.co.uk site. When I tried to get a refund for the order that was not delivered they told me i have to call the UK as the companies are separate? When I asked them if the companies are separate how come the UK Amazon has all of my personal information? They told me that they share information with all Amazon companies but if there is a problem with an order then the client has to call Amazon in the country where the order was placed?!? I wonder what the GDPR authorities have to say about such a casual attitude to the GDPR privacy protection law? I also live in a an apartment with another family and although we have separate Amazon accounts and Prime accounts, Amazon regularly mixes up our orders and cross utilizes our credit cards?? I don't think that this is legal and when i complain to them it's ""well it's our policy""??? Terrible arrogant company."	N/A, US	4 reviews	1

amazon	dogtown23	2010-04-17T21:53:20Z	I have happily cut Amazon out of my life entirely.  I do not purchase anything for my business or home from them due to their  awful customer service when I was a paying Prime customer.  The csr's I have spoken to were not helpful and did not attempt to solve the two problems I have ever had to call about.   Both times I have called were about Amazon sold and fulfilled products that were faulty or defective and cost less than $20 each.   They only would say it was my problem and that I should get in touch with the manufacturer and that Amazon would do nothing and would not provide any assistance in getting product replaced.

amazon	Leo Terrell	2010-04-10T02:14:53Z	Everyone goes to the store to search for what they want and when it comes to online shopping it is very convenient. Amazon is a very well-known and great place to go online and shop for certain products. Although, Amazon is literally taking over the world and making businesses and companies out of business it is still the best online shopping place, because service can be extremely fast, there are lots of discounts on products, and the products are just very useful.My family has amazon prime and we can buy products and get them in two days. You even get discounts too, there was a product that my parents were gonna buy for $60, but with amazon prime the price went down to $20. Can you believe it? Although, many businesses and companies are going out of business, Amazon has everything you need at a good price and good shipping. Amazon is a very great place to shop and their products are always in good condition,  hopefully they never run out of business.	N/A, US	1 review	5

amazon	Mick	2010-11-04T13:38:52Z	"Two options: 1) Average prices, lousy service and China slow delivery. 2) Average prices, lousy service, expensive shipping membership, same shipping time that other retailers offer for free.Amazon non-Prime customers receive a lower standard of customer service. Also, Amazon intentionally inconveniences Non-Prime customers by delaying shipping for an unreasonable amount of time in an attempt to manipulate shoppers into buying Prime.Product prices are initially adjusted up to cover shipping, and then they want you to buy Prime in order to receive it in a reasonable amount of time. Prime two day delivery is nothing special, it's not offered on all products and often unreliable. I receive eBay and Walmart orders before Amazon. I placed three separate orders over a period of three days, only one showed ""shipped"" four days after placing the last order. It was the last order I placed that showed and It only shipped because I had attempted to cancel that order. The status just happened to change at the exact time I tried to cancel, so that I couldn't cancel. And, it sat in the warehouse for days after that.  Amazon may be a fair deal for customers who find enough value in the other services offered with Prime membership and shop enough to justify purchasing it. However, it is not a fair marketplace for the infrequent shopping non-Prime customer.Amazon no longer passes along savings to customers. Aside from initial pocketing, the company uses it's profits for huge advertising and massive expansion."	N/A, US	1 review	2

amazon	dogtown23	2010-04-17T21:53:20Z	I have happily cut Amazon out of my life entirely.  I do not purchase anything for my business or home from them due to their  awful customer service when I was a paying Prime customer.  The csr's I have spoken to were not helpful and did not attempt to solve the two problems I have ever had to call about.   Both times I have called were about Amazon sold and fulfilled products that were faulty or defective and cost less than $20 each.   They only would say it was my problem and that I should get in touch with the manufacturer and that Amazon would do nothing and would not provide any assistance in getting product replaced.

amazon	Leo Terrell	2010-04-10T02:14:53Z	Everyone goes to the store to search for what they want and when it comes to online shopping it is very convenient. Amazon is a very well-known and great place to go online and shop for certain products. Although, Amazon is literally taking over the world and making businesses and companies out of business it is still the best online shopping place, because service can be extremely fast, there are lots of discounts on products, and the products are just very useful.My family has amazon prime and we can buy products and get them in two days. You even get discounts too, there was a product that my parents were gonna buy for $60, but with amazon prime the price went down to $20. Can you believe it? Although, many businesses and companies are going out of business, Amazon has everything you need at a good price and good shipping. Amazon is a very great place to shop and their products are always in good condition,  hopefully they never run out of business.	N/A, US	1 review	5

Also, Amazon intentionally inconveniences Non-Prime customers by delaying shipping for an unreasonable amount of time in an attempt to manipulate shoppers into buying Prime.Product prices are initially adjusted up to cover shipping, and then they want you to buy Prime in order to receive it in a reasonable amount of time. Prime two day delivery is nothing special, it's not offered on all products and often unreliable. I receive eBay and Walmart orders before Amazon. I placed three separate orders over a period of three days, only one showed ""shipped"" four days after placing the last order. It was the last order I placed that showed and It only shipped because I had attempted to cancel that order. The status just happened to change at the exact time I tried to cancel, so that I couldn't cancel. And, it sat in the warehouse for days after that.  Amazon may be a fair deal for customers who find enough value in the other services offered with Prime membership and shop enough to justify purchasing it. However, it is not a fair marketplace for the infrequent shopping non-Prime customer.Amazon no longer passes along savings to customers. Aside from initial pocketing, the company uses it's profits for huge advertising and massive expansion."	N/A, US	1 review	2
amazon	Luther Tan	2010-11-03T12:15:51Z	I believe giving them 3 stars is a fair rating. My experiences with Amazon is similar to a love hate relationship. At times, the items I ordered gets delivered on time and in perfect condition which I am very grateful of. But other times, my items are either slightly damaged or late. I had to return them and it will take ages for the item to be sent back before a replacement arrives. Dilemma indeed!	N/A, MY	6 reviews	3

amazon	Eelasor, Idaho	2010-09-01T19:23:37Z	My experience with making purchases from Amazon has usually been a positive one.  However, in the event that a product I purchase is incorrect and the fault is from a third party seller, Amazon has often provided a refund or told me to keep the item.  There have also been times when experiencing certain issues regarding an item to be purchased, and  they have offered courtesy services such as free shipping or percentages off an item when applicable.For the most part, if someone search for good pricing deals they will find it here, especially for good used books and other good used products as well.

When I went to Amazon all of my personal information including my credit cards were stored on the Amazon.co.uk site. When I tried to get a refund for the order that was not delivered they told me i have to call the UK as the companies are separate? When I asked them if the companies are separate how come the UK Amazon has all of my personal information? They told me that they share information with all Amazon companies but if there is a problem with an order then the client has to call Amazon in the country where the order was placed?!? I wonder what the GDPR authorities have to say about such a casual attitude to the GDPR privacy protection law? I also live in a an apartment with another family and although we have separate Amazon accounts and Prime accounts, Amazon regularly mixes up our orders and cross utilizes our credit cards??

Also, Amazon intentionally inconveniences Non-Prime customers by delaying shipping for an unreasonable amount of time in an attempt to manipulate shoppers into buying Prime.Product prices are initially adjusted up to cover shipping, and then they want you to buy Prime in order to receive it in a reasonable amount of time. Prime two day delivery is nothing special, it's not offered on all products and often unreliable. I receive eBay and Walmart orders before Amazon. I placed three separate orders over a period of three days, only one showed ""shipped"" four days after placing the last order. It was the last order I placed that showed and It only shipped because I had attempted to cancel that order. The status just happened to change at the exact time I tried to cancel, so that I couldn't cancel. And, it sat in the warehouse for days after that.  Amazon may be a fair deal for customers who find enough value in the other services offered with Prime membership and shop enough to justify purchasing it. However, it is not a fair marketplace for the infrequent shopping non-Prime customer.Amazon no longer passes along savings to customers. Aside from initial pocketing, the company uses it's profits for huge advertising and massive expansion."	N/A, US	1 review	2
amazon	Luther Tan	2010-11-03T12:15:51Z	I believe giving them 3 stars is a fair rating. My experiences with Amazon is similar to a love hate relationship. At times, the items I ordered gets delivered on time and in perfect condition which I am very grateful of. But other times, my items are either slightly damaged or late. I had to return them and it will take ages for the item to be sent back before a replacement arrives. Dilemma indeed!	N/A, MY	6 reviews	3

amazon	Eelasor, Idaho	2010-09-01T19:23:37Z	My experience with making purchases from Amazon has usually been a positive one.  However, in the event that a product I purchase is incorrect and the fault is from a third party seller, Amazon has often provided a refund or told me to keep the item.  There have also been times when experiencing certain issues regarding an item to be purchased, and  they have offered courtesy services such as free shipping or percentages off an item when applicable.For the most part, if someone search for good pricing deals they will find it here, especially for good used books and other good used products as well.

When I went to Amazon all of my personal information including my credit cards were stored on the Amazon.co.uk site. When I tried to get a refund for the order that was not delivered they told me i have to call the UK as the companies are separate? When I asked them if the companies are separate how come the UK Amazon has all of my personal information? They told me that they share information with all Amazon companies but if there is a problem with an order then the client has to call Amazon in the country where the order was placed?!? I wonder what the GDPR authorities have to say about such a casual attitude to the GDPR privacy protection law? I also live in a an apartment with another family and although we have separate Amazon accounts and Prime accounts, Amazon regularly mixes up our orders and cross utilizes our credit cards?? I don't think that this is legal and when i complain to them it's ""well it's our policy""??? Terrible arrogant company."	N/A, US	4 reviews	1

I do not purchase anything for my business or home from them due to their  awful customer service when I was a paying Prime customer.  The csr's I have spoken to were not helpful and did not attempt to solve the two problems I have ever had to call about.   Both times I have called were about Amazon sold and fulfilled products that were faulty or defective and cost less than $20 each.   They only would say it was my problem and that I should get in touch with the manufacturer and that Amazon would do nothing and would not provide any assistance in getting product replaced.

amazon	Leo Terrell	2010-04-10T02:14:53Z	Everyone goes to the store to search for what they want and when it comes to online shopping it is very convenient. Amazon is a very well-known and great place to go online and shop for certain products. Although, Amazon is literally taking over the world and making businesses and companies out of business it is still the best online shopping place, because service can be extremely fast, there are lots of discounts on products, and the products are just very useful.My family has amazon prime and we can buy products and get them in two days. You even get discounts too, there was a product that my parents were gonna buy for $60, but with amazon prime the price went down to $20. Can you believe it? Although, many businesses and companies are going out of business, Amazon has everything you need at a good price and good shipping. Amazon is a very great place to shop and their products are always in good condition,  hopefully they never run out of business.	N/A, US	1 review	5

amazon	Eelasor, Idaho	2010-09-01T19:23:37Z	My experience with making purchases from Amazon has usually been a positive one.  However, in the event that a product I purchase is incorrect and the fault is from a third party seller, Amazon has often provided a refund or told me to keep the item.  There have also been times when experiencing certain issues regarding an item to be purchased, and  they have offered courtesy services such as free shipping or percentages off an item when applicable.For the most part, if someone search for good pricing deals they will find it here, especially for good used books and other good used products as well.

amazon	anthony genth	2010-07-14T11:19:41Z	"Amazon is too big and completely out of control! I placed an order with Amazon while traveling on business in the UK. When I went to Amazon all of my personal information including my credit cards were stored on the Amazon.co.uk site. When I tried to get a refund for the order that was not delivered they told me i have to call the UK as the companies are separate? When I asked them if the companies are separate how come the UK Amazon has all of my personal information? They told me that they share information with all Amazon companies but if there is a problem with an order then the client has to call Amazon in the country where the order was placed?!? I wonder what the GDPR authorities have to say about such a casual attitude to the GDPR privacy protection law? I also live in a an apartment with another family and although we have separate Amazon accounts and Prime accounts, Amazon regularly mixes up our orders and cross utilizes our credit cards?? I don't think that this is legal and when i complain to them it's ""well it's our policy""??? Terrible arrogant company."	N/A, US	4 reviews	1

amazon	dogtown23	2010-04-17T21:53:20Z	I have happily cut Amazon out of my life entirely.  I do not purchase anything for my business or home from them due to their  awful customer service when I was a paying Prime customer.  The csr's I have spoken to were not helpful and did not attempt to solve the two problems I have ever had to call about.   Both times I have called were about Amazon sold and fulfilled products that were faulty or defective and cost less than $20 each.   They only would say it was my problem and that I should get in touch with the manufacturer and that Amazon would do nothing and would not provide any assistance in getting product replaced.

amazon	Leo Terrell	2010-04-10T02:14:53Z	Everyone goes to the store to search for what they want and when it comes to online shopping it is very convenient. Amazon is a very well-known and great place to go online and shop for certain products. Although, Amazon is literally taking over the world and making businesses and companies out of business it is still the best online shopping place, because service can be extremely fast, there are lots of discounts on products, and the products are just very useful.My family has amazon prime and we can buy products and get them in two days. You even get discounts too, there was a product that my parents were gonna buy for $60, but with amazon prime the price went down to $20. Can you believe it? Although, many businesses and companies are going out of business, Amazon has everything you need at a good price and good shipping. Amazon is a very great place to shop and their products are always in good condition,  hopefully they never run out of business.	N/A, US	1 review	5

Also, Amazon intentionally inconveniences Non-Prime customers by delaying shipping for an unreasonable amount of time in an attempt to manipulate shoppers into buying Prime.Product prices are initially adjusted up to cover shipping, and then they want you to buy Prime in order to receive it in a reasonable amount of time. Prime two day delivery is nothing special, it's not offered on all products and often unreliable. I receive eBay and Walmart orders before Amazon. I placed three separate orders over a period of three days, only one showed ""shipped"" four days after placing the last order. It was the last order I placed that showed and It only shipped because I had attempted to cancel that order. The status just happened to change at the exact time I tried to cancel, so that I couldn't cancel. And, it sat in the warehouse for days after that.  Amazon may be a fair deal for customers who find enough value in the other services offered with Prime membership and shop enough to justify purchasing it. However, it is not a fair marketplace for the infrequent shopping non-Prime customer.Amazon no longer passes along savings to customers. Aside from initial pocketing, the company uses it's profits for huge advertising and massive expansion."	N/A, US	1 review	2

There have also been times when experiencing certain issues regarding an item to be purchased, and  they have offered courtesy services such as free shipping or percentages off an item when applicable.For the most part, if someone search for good pricing deals they will find it here, especially for good used books and other good used products as well.

amazon	anthony genth	2010-07-14T11:19:41Z	"Amazon is too big and completely out of control! I placed an order with Amazon while traveling on business in the UK. When I went to Amazon all of my personal information including my credit cards were stored on the Amazon.co.uk site. When I tried to get a refund for the order that was not delivered they told me i have to call the UK as the companies are separate? When I asked them if the companies are separate how come the UK Amazon has all of my personal information? They told me that they share information with all Amazon companies but if there is a problem with an order then the client has to call Amazon in the country where the order was placed?!? I wonder what the GDPR authorities have to say about such a casual attitude to the GDPR privacy protection law? I also live in a an apartment with another family and although we have separate Amazon accounts and Prime accounts, Amazon regularly mixes up our orders and cross utilizes our credit cards?? I don't think that this is legal and when i complain to them it's ""well it's our policy""??? Terrible arrogant company."	N/A, US	4 reviews	1

amazon	dogtown23	2010-04-17T21:53:20Z	I have happily cut Amazon out of my life entirely.  I do not purchase anything for my business or home from them due to their  awful customer service when I was a paying Prime customer.  The csr's I have spoken to were not helpful and did not attempt to solve the two problems I have ever had to call about.   Both times I have called were about Amazon sold and fulfilled products that were faulty or defective and cost less than $20 each.   They only would say it was my problem and that I should get in touch with the manufacturer and that Amazon would do nothing and would not provide any assistance in getting product replaced.

amazon	Leo Terrell	2010-04-10T02:14:53Z	Everyone goes to the store to search for what they want and when it comes to online shopping it is very convenient. Amazon is a very well-known and great place to go online and shop for certain products. Although, Amazon is literally taking over the world and making businesses and companies out of business it is still the best online shopping place, because service can be extremely fast, there are lots of discounts on products, and the products are just very useful.My family has amazon prime and we can buy products and get them in two days. You even get discounts too, there was a product that my parents were gonna buy for $60, but with amazon prime the price went down to $20. Can you believe it? Although, many businesses and companies are going out of business, Amazon has everything you need at a good price and good shipping. Amazon is a very great place to shop and their products are always in good condition,  hopefully they never run out of business.	N/A, US	1 review	5

amazon	Mick	2010-11-04T13:38:52Z	"Two options: 1) Average prices, lousy service and China slow delivery. 2) Average prices, lousy service, expensive shipping membership, same shipping time that other retailers offer for free.Amazon non-Prime customers receive a lower standard of customer service. Also, Amazon intentionally inconveniences Non-Prime customers by delaying shipping for an unreasonable amount of time in an attempt to manipulate shoppers into buying Prime.Product prices are initially adjusted up to cover shipping, and then they want you to buy Prime in order to receive it in a reasonable amount of time. Prime two day delivery is nothing special, it's not offered on all products and often unreliable. I receive eBay and Walmart orders before Amazon. I placed three separate orders over a period of three days, only one showed ""shipped"" four days after placing the last order. It was the last order I placed that showed and It only shipped because I had attempted to cancel that order. The status just happened to change at the exact time I tried to cancel, so that I couldn't cancel. And, it sat in the warehouse for days after that.  Amazon may be a fair deal for customers who find enough value in the other services offered with Prime membership and shop enough to justify purchasing it. However, it is not a fair marketplace for the infrequent shopping non-Prime customer.Amazon no longer passes along savings to customers. Aside from initial pocketing, the company uses it's profits for huge advertising and massive expansion."	N/A, US	1 review	2

amazon	Leo Terrell	2010-04-10T02:14:53Z	Everyone goes to the store to search for what they want and when it comes to online shopping it is very convenient. Amazon is a very well-known and great place to go online and shop for certain products. Although, Amazon is literally taking over the world and making businesses and companies out of business it is still the best online shopping place, because service can be extremely fast, there are lots of discounts on products, and the products are just very useful.My family has amazon prime and we can buy products and get them in two days. You even get discounts too, there was a product that my parents were gonna buy for $60, but with amazon prime the price went down to $20. Can you believe it? Although, many businesses and companies are going out of business, Amazon has everything you need at a good price and good shipping. Amazon is a very great place to shop and their products are always in good condition,  hopefully they never run out of business.	N/A, US	1 review	5

Also, Amazon intentionally inconveniences Non-Prime customers by delaying shipping for an unreasonable amount of time in an attempt to manipulate shoppers into buying Prime.Product prices are initially adjusted up to cover shipping, and then they want you to buy Prime in order to receive it in a reasonable amount of time. Prime two day delivery is nothing special, it's not offered on all products and often unreliable. I receive eBay and Walmart orders before Amazon. I placed three separate orders over a period of three days, only one showed ""shipped"" four days after placing the last order. It was the last order I placed that showed and It only shipped because I had attempted to cancel that order. The status just happened to change at the exact time I tried to cancel, so that I couldn't cancel. And, it sat in the warehouse for days after that.  Amazon may be a fair deal for customers who find enough value in the other services offered with Prime membership and shop enough to justify purchasing it. However, it is not a fair marketplace for the infrequent shopping non-Prime customer.Amazon no longer passes along savings to customers. Aside from initial pocketing, the company uses it's profits for huge advertising and massive expansion."	N/A, US	1 review	2

At times, the items I ordered gets delivered on time and in perfect condition which I am very grateful of. But other times, my items are either slightly damaged or late.

amazon	Eelasor, Idaho	2010-09-01T19:23:37Z	My experience with making purchases from Amazon has usually been a positive one.  However, in the event that a product I purchase is incorrect and the fault is from a third party seller, Amazon has often provided a refund or told me to keep the item.  There have also been times when experiencing certain issues regarding an item to be purchased, and  they have offered courtesy services such as free shipping or percentages off an item when applicable.For the most part, if someone search for good pricing deals they will find it here, especially for good used books and other good used products as well.

When I went to Amazon all of my personal information including my credit cards were stored on the Amazon.co.uk site.

When I asked them if the companies are separate how come the UK Amazon has all of my personal information? They told me that they share information with all Amazon companies but if there is a problem with an order then the client has to call Amazon in the country where the order was placed?!?

I also live in a an apartment with another family and although we have separate Amazon accounts and Prime accounts, Amazon regularly mixes up our orders and cross utilizes our credit cards??

amazon	Luther Tan	2010-11-03T12:15:51Z	I believe giving them 3 stars is a fair rating. My experiences with Amazon is similar to a love hate relationship. At times, the items I ordered gets delivered on time and in perfect condition which I am very grateful of. But other times, my items are either slightly damaged or late. I had to return them and it will take ages for the item to be sent back before a replacement arrives. Dilemma indeed!	N/A, MY	6 reviews	3

amazon	Eelasor, Idaho	2010-09-01T19:23:37Z	My experience with making purchases from Amazon has usually been a positive one.  However, in the event that a product I purchase is incorrect and the fault is from a third party seller, Amazon has often provided a refund or told me to keep the item.  There have also been times when experiencing certain issues regarding an item to be purchased, and  they have offered courtesy services such as free shipping or percentages off an item when applicable.For the most part, if someone search for good pricing deals they will find it here, especially for good used books and other good used products as well.

When I went to Amazon all of my personal information including my credit cards were stored on the Amazon.co.uk site. When I tried to get a refund for the order that was not delivered they told me i have to call the UK as the companies are separate? When I asked them if the companies are separate how come the UK Amazon has all of my personal information? They told me that they share information with all Amazon companies but if there is a problem with an order then the client has to call Amazon in the country where the order was placed?!? I wonder what the GDPR authorities have to say about such a casual attitude to the GDPR privacy protection law? I also live in a an apartment with another family and although we have separate Amazon accounts and Prime accounts, Amazon regularly mixes up our orders and cross utilizes our credit cards?? I don't think that this is legal and when i complain to them it's ""well it's our policy""??? Terrible arrogant company."	N/A, US	4 reviews	1

amazon	dogtown23	2010-04-17T21:53:20Z	I have happily cut Amazon out of my life entirely.  I do not purchase anything for my business or home from them due to their  awful customer service when I was a paying Prime customer.  The csr's I have spoken to were not helpful and did not attempt to solve the two problems I have ever had to call about.   Both times I have called were about Amazon sold and fulfilled products that were faulty or defective and cost less than $20 each.   They only would say it was my problem and that I should get in touch with the manufacturer and that Amazon would do nothing and would not provide any assistance in getting product replaced.

amazon	Leo Terrell	2010-04-10T02:14:53Z	Everyone goes to the store to search for what they want and when it comes to online shopping it is very convenient. Amazon is a very well-known and great place to go online and shop for certain products. Although, Amazon is literally taking over the world and making businesses and companies out of business it is still the best online shopping place, because service can be extremely fast, there are lots of discounts on products, and the products are just very useful.My family has amazon prime and we can buy products and get them in two days. You even get discounts too, there was a product that my parents were gonna buy for $60, but with amazon prime the price went down to $20. Can you believe it? Although, many businesses and companies are going out of business, Amazon has everything you need at a good price and good shipping. Amazon is a very great place to shop and their products are always in good condition,  hopefully they never run out of business.	N/A, US	1 review	5

amazon	Eelasor, Idaho	2010-09-01T19:23:37Z	My experience with making purchases from Amazon has usually been a positive one.  However, in the event that a product I purchase is incorrect and the fault is from a third party seller, Amazon has often provided a refund or told me to keep the item.  There have also been times when experiencing certain issues regarding an item to be purchased, and  they have offered courtesy services such as free shipping or percentages off an item when applicable.For the most part, if someone search for good pricing deals they will find it here, especially for good used books and other good used products as well.

amazon	anthony genth	2010-07-14T11:19:41Z	"Amazon is too big and completely out of control! I placed an order with Amazon while traveling on business in the UK. When I went to Amazon all of my personal information including my credit cards were stored on the Amazon.co.uk site. When I tried to get a refund for the order that was not delivered they told me i have to call the UK as the companies are separate? When I asked them if the companies are separate how come the UK Amazon has all of my personal information? They told me that they share information with all Amazon companies but if there is a problem with an order then the client has to call Amazon in the country where the order was placed?!? I wonder what the GDPR authorities have to say about such a casual attitude to the GDPR privacy protection law? I also live in a an apartment with another family and although we have separate Amazon accounts and Prime accounts, Amazon regularly mixes up our orders and cross utilizes our credit cards?? I don't think that this is legal and when i complain to them it's ""well it's our policy""??? Terrible arrogant company."	N/A, US	4 reviews	1

amazon	dogtown23	2010-04-17T21:53:20Z	I have happily cut Amazon out of my life entirely.  I do not purchase anything for my business or home from them due to their  awful customer service when I was a paying Prime customer.  The csr's I have spoken to were not helpful and did not attempt to solve the two problems I have ever had to call about.   Both times I have called were about Amazon sold and fulfilled products that were faulty or defective and cost less than $20 each.   They only would say it was my problem and that I should get in touch with the manufacturer and that Amazon would do nothing and would not provide any assistance in getting product replaced.

amazon	Leo Terrell	2010-04-10T02:14:53Z	Everyone goes to the store to search for what they want and when it comes to online shopping it is very convenient. Amazon is a very well-known and great place to go online and shop for certain products. Although, Amazon is literally taking over the world and making businesses and companies out of business it is still the best online shopping place, because service can be extremely fast, there are lots of discounts on products, and the products are just very useful.My family has amazon prime and we can buy products and get them in two days. You even get discounts too, there was a product that my parents were gonna buy for $60, but with amazon prime the price went down to $20. Can you believe it? Although, many businesses and companies are going out of business, Amazon has everything you need at a good price and good shipping. Amazon is a very great place to shop and their products are always in good condition,  hopefully they never run out of business.	N/A, US	1 review	5

amazon	Mick	2010-11-04T13:38:52Z	"Two options: 1) Average prices, lousy service and China slow delivery. 2) Average prices, lousy service, expensive shipping membership, same shipping time that other retailers offer for free.Amazon non-Prime customers receive a lower standard of customer service. Also, Amazon intentionally inconveniences Non-Prime customers by delaying shipping for an unreasonable amount of time in an attempt to manipulate shoppers into buying Prime.Product prices are initially adjusted up to cover shipping, and then they want you to buy Prime in order to receive it in a reasonable amount of time. Prime two day delivery is nothing special, it's not offered on all products and often unreliable. I receive eBay and Walmart orders before Amazon. I placed three separate orders over a period of three days, only one showed ""shipped"" four days after placing the last order. It was the last order I placed that showed and It only shipped because I had attempted to cancel that order. The status just happened to change at the exact time I tried to cancel, so that I couldn't cancel. And, it sat in the warehouse for days after that.  Amazon may be a fair deal for customers who find enough value in the other services offered with Prime membership and shop enough to justify purchasing it. However, it is not a fair marketplace for the infrequent shopping non-Prime customer.Amazon no longer passes along savings to customers. Aside from initial pocketing, the company uses it's profits for huge advertising and massive expansion."	N/A, US	1 review	2

amazon	dogtown23	2010-04-17T21:53:20Z	I have happily cut Amazon out of my life entirely.  I do not purchase anything for my business or home from them due to their  awful customer service when I was a paying Prime customer.  The csr's I have spoken to were not helpful and did not attempt to solve the two problems I have ever had to call about.   Both times I have called were about Amazon sold and fulfilled products that were faulty or defective and cost less than $20 each.   They only would say it was my problem and that I should get in touch with the manufacturer and that Amazon would do nothing and would not provide any assistance in getting product replaced.

amazon	Leo Terrell	2010-04-10T02:14:53Z	Everyone goes to the store to search for what they want and when it comes to online shopping it is very convenient. Amazon is a very well-known and great place to go online and shop for certain products. Although, Amazon is literally taking over the world and making businesses and companies out of business it is still the best online shopping place, because service can be extremely fast, there are lots of discounts on products, and the products are just very useful.My family has amazon prime and we can buy products and get them in two days. You even get discounts too, there was a product that my parents were gonna buy for $60, but with amazon prime the price went down to $20. Can you believe it? Although, many businesses and companies are going out of business, Amazon has everything you need at a good price and good shipping. Amazon is a very great place to shop and their products are always in good condition,  hopefully they never run out of business.	N/A, US	1 review	5

Also, Amazon intentionally inconveniences Non-Prime customers by delaying shipping for an unreasonable amount of time in an attempt to manipulate shoppers into buying Prime.Product prices are initially adjusted up to cover shipping, and then they want you to buy Prime in order to receive it in a reasonable amount of time. Prime two day delivery is nothing special, it's not offered on all products and often unreliable. I receive eBay and Walmart orders before Amazon. I placed three separate orders over a period of three days, only one showed ""shipped"" four days after placing the last order. It was the last order I placed that showed and It only shipped because I had attempted to cancel that order. The status just happened to change at the exact time I tried to cancel, so that I couldn't cancel. And, it sat in the warehouse for days after that.  Amazon may be a fair deal for customers who find enough value in the other services offered with Prime membership and shop enough to justify purchasing it. However, it is not a fair marketplace for the infrequent shopping non-Prime customer.Amazon no longer passes along savings to customers. Aside from initial pocketing, the company uses it's profits for huge advertising and massive expansion."	N/A, US	1 review	2
amazon	Luther Tan	2010-11-03T12:15:51Z	I believe giving them 3 stars is a fair rating. My experiences with Amazon is similar to a love hate relationship. At times, the items I ordered gets delivered on time and in perfect condition which I am very grateful of. But other times, my items are either slightly damaged or late. I had to return them and it will take ages for the item to be sent back before a replacement arrives. Dilemma indeed!	N/A, MY	6 reviews	3

amazon	Eelasor, Idaho	2010-09-01T19:23:37Z	My experience with making purchases from Amazon has usually been a positive one.  However, in the event that a product I purchase is incorrect and the fault is from a third party seller, Amazon has often provided a refund or told me to keep the item.  There have also been times when experiencing certain issues regarding an item to be purchased, and  they have offered courtesy services such as free shipping or percentages off an item when applicable.For the most part, if someone search for good pricing deals they will find it here, especially for good used books and other good used products as well.

When I went to Amazon all of my personal information including my credit cards were stored on the Amazon.co.uk site. When I tried to get a refund for the order that was not delivered they told me i have to call the UK as the companies are separate? When I asked them if the companies are separate how come the UK Amazon has all of my personal information? They told me that they share information with all Amazon companies but if there is a problem with an order then the client has to call Amazon in the country where the order was placed?!? I wonder what the GDPR authorities have to say about such a casual attitude to the GDPR privacy protection law? I also live in a an apartment with another family and although we have separate Amazon accounts and Prime accounts, Amazon regularly mixes up our orders and cross utilizes our credit cards??

Also, Amazon intentionally inconveniences Non-Prime customers by delaying shipping for an unreasonable amount of time in an attempt to manipulate shoppers into buying Prime.Product prices are initially adjusted up to cover shipping, and then they want you to buy Prime in order to receive it in a reasonable amount of time. Prime two day delivery is nothing special, it's not offered on all products and often unreliable. I receive eBay and Walmart orders before Amazon. I placed three separate orders over a period of three days, only one showed ""shipped"" four days after placing the last order. It was the last order I placed that showed and It only shipped because I had attempted to cancel that order. The status just happened to change at the exact time I tried to cancel, so that I couldn't cancel. And, it sat in the warehouse for days after that.  Amazon may be a fair deal for customers who find enough value in the other services offered with Prime membership and shop enough to justify purchasing it. However, it is not a fair marketplace for the infrequent shopping non-Prime customer.Amazon no longer passes along savings to customers. Aside from initial pocketing, the company uses it's profits for huge advertising and massive expansion."	N/A, US	1 review	2
amazon	Luther Tan	2010-11-03T12:15:51Z	I believe giving them 3 stars is a fair rating. My experiences with Amazon is similar to a love hate relationship. At times, the items I ordered gets delivered on time and in perfect condition which I am very grateful of. But other times, my items are either slightly damaged or late. I had to return them and it will take ages for the item to be sent back before a replacement arrives. Dilemma indeed!	N/A, MY	6 reviews	3

amazon	Eelasor, Idaho	2010-09-01T19:23:37Z	My experience with making purchases from Amazon has usually been a positive one.  However, in the event that a product I purchase is incorrect and the fault is from a third party seller, Amazon has often provided a refund or told me to keep the item.  There have also been times when experiencing certain issues regarding an item to be purchased, and  they have offered courtesy services such as free shipping or percentages off an item when applicable.For the most part, if someone search for good pricing deals they will find it here, especially for good used books and other good used products as well.

When I went to Amazon all of my personal information including my credit cards were stored on the Amazon.co.uk site. When I tried to get a refund for the order that was not delivered they told me i have to call the UK as the companies are separate? When I asked them if the companies are separate how come the UK Amazon has all of my personal information? They told me that they share information with all Amazon companies but if there is a problem with an order then the client has to call Amazon in the country where the order was placed?!? I wonder what the GDPR authorities have to say about such a casual attitude to the GDPR privacy protection law? I also live in a an apartment with another family and although we have separate Amazon accounts and Prime accounts, Amazon regularly mixes up our orders and cross utilizes our credit cards?? I don't think that this is legal and when i complain to them it's ""well it's our policy""??? Terrible arrogant company."	N/A, US	4 reviews	1

I do not purchase anything for my business or home from them due to their  awful customer service when I was a paying Prime customer.  The csr's I have spoken to were not helpful and did not attempt to solve the two problems I have ever had to call about.   Both times I have called were about Amazon sold and fulfilled products that were faulty or defective and cost less than $20 each.   They only would say it was my problem and that I should get in touch with the manufacturer and that Amazon would do nothing and would not provide any assistance in getting product replaced.

amazon	Leo Terrell	2010-04-10T02:14:53Z	Everyone goes to the store to search for what they want and when it comes to online shopping it is very convenient. Amazon is a very well-known and great place to go online and shop for certain products. Although, Amazon is literally taking over the world and making businesses and companies out of business it is still the best online shopping place, because service can be extremely fast, there are lots of discounts on products, and the products are just very useful.My family has amazon prime and we can buy products and get them in two days. You even get discounts too, there was a product that my parents were gonna buy for $60, but with amazon prime the price went down to $20. Can you believe it? Although, many businesses and companies are going out of business, Amazon has everything you need at a good price and good shipping. Amazon is a very great place to shop and their products are always in good condition,  hopefully they never run out of business.	N/A, US	1 review	5

amazon	Eelasor, Idaho	2010-09-01T19:23:37Z	My experience with making purchases from Amazon has usually been a positive one.  However, in the event that a product I purchase is incorrect and the fault is from a third party seller, Amazon has often provided a refund or told me to keep the item.  There have also been times when experiencing certain issues regarding an item to be purchased, and  they have offered courtesy services such as free shipping or percentages off an item when applicable.For the most part, if someone search for good pricing deals they will find it here, especially for good used books and other good used products as well.

amazon	anthony genth	2010-07-14T11:19:41Z	"Amazon is too big and completely out of control! I placed an order with Amazon while traveling on business in the UK. When I went to Amazon all of my personal information including my credit cards were stored on the Amazon.co.uk site. When I tried to get a refund for the order that was not delivered they told me i have to call the UK as the companies are separate? When I asked them if the companies are separate how come the UK Amazon has all of my personal information? They told me that they share information with all Amazon companies but if there is a problem with an order then the client has to call Amazon in the country where the order was placed?!? I wonder what the GDPR authorities have to say about such a casual attitude to the GDPR privacy protection law? I also live in a an apartment with another family and although we have separate Amazon accounts and Prime accounts, Amazon regularly mixes up our orders and cross utilizes our credit cards?? I don't think that this is legal and when i complain to them it's ""well it's our policy""??? Terrible arrogant company."	N/A, US	4 reviews	1

amazon	dogtown23	2010-04-17T21:53:20Z	I have happily cut Amazon out of my life entirely.  I do not purchase anything for my business or home from them due to their  awful customer service when I was a paying Prime customer.  The csr's I have spoken to were not helpful and did not attempt to solve the two problems I have ever had to call about.   Both times I have called were about Amazon sold and fulfilled products that were faulty or defective and cost less than $20 each.   They only would say it was my problem and that I should get in touch with the manufacturer and that Amazon would do nothing and would not provide any assistance in getting product replaced.

amazon	Leo Terrell	2010-04-10T02:14:53Z	Everyone goes to the store to search for what they want and when it comes to online shopping it is very convenient. Amazon is a very well-known and great place to go online and shop for certain products. Although, Amazon is literally taking over the world and making businesses and companies out of business it is still the best online shopping place, because service can be extremely fast, there are lots of discounts on products, and the products are just very useful.My family has amazon prime and we can buy products and get them in two days. You even get discounts too, there was a product that my parents were gonna buy for $60, but with amazon prime the price went down to $20. Can you believe it? Although, many businesses and companies are going out of business, Amazon has everything you need at a good price and good shipping. Amazon is a very great place to shop and their products are always in good condition,  hopefully they never run out of business.	N/A, US	1 review	5

Also, Amazon intentionally inconveniences Non-Prime customers by delaying shipping for an unreasonable amount of time in an attempt to manipulate shoppers into buying Prime.Product prices are initially adjusted up to cover shipping, and then they want you to buy Prime in order to receive it in a reasonable amount of time. Prime two day delivery is nothing special, it's not offered on all products and often unreliable. I receive eBay and Walmart orders before Amazon. I placed three separate orders over a period of three days, only one showed ""shipped"" four days after placing the last order. It was the last order I placed that showed and It only shipped because I had attempted to cancel that order. The status just happened to change at the exact time I tried to cancel, so that I couldn't cancel. And, it sat in the warehouse for days after that.  Amazon may be a fair deal for customers who find enough value in the other services offered with Prime membership and shop enough to justify purchasing it. However, it is not a fair marketplace for the infrequent shopping non-Prime customer.Amazon no longer passes along savings to customers. Aside from initial pocketing, the company uses it's profits for huge advertising and massive expansion."	N/A, US	1 review	2

There have also been times when experiencing certain issues regarding an item to be purchased, and  they have offered courtesy services such as free shipping or percentages off an item when applicable.For the most part, if someone search for good pricing deals they will find it here, especially for good used books and other good used products as well.

amazon	anthony genth	2010-07-14T11:19:41Z	"Amazon is too big and completely out of control! I placed an order with Amazon while traveling on business in the UK. When I went to Amazon all of my personal information including my credit cards were stored on the Amazon.co.uk site. When I tried to get a refund for the order that was not delivered they told me i have to call the UK as the companies are separate? When I asked them if the companies are separate how come the UK Amazon has all of my personal information? They told me that they share information with all Amazon companies but if there is a problem with an order then the client has to call Amazon in the country where the order was placed?!? I wonder what the GDPR authorities have to say about such a casual attitude to the GDPR privacy protection law? I also live in a an apartment with another family and although we have separate Amazon accounts and Prime accounts, Amazon regularly mixes up our orders and cross utilizes our credit cards?? I don't think that this is legal and when i complain to them it's ""well it's our policy""??? Terrible arrogant company."	N/A, US	4 reviews	1

amazon	dogtown23	2010-04-17T21:53:20Z	I have happily cut Amazon out of my life entirely.  I do not purchase anything for my business or home from them due to their  awful customer service when I was a paying Prime customer.  The csr's I have spoken to were not helpful and did not attempt to solve the two problems I have ever had to call about.   Both times I have called were about Amazon sold and fulfilled products that were faulty or defective and cost less than $20 each.   They only would say it was my problem and that I should get in touch with the manufacturer and that Amazon would do nothing and would not provide any assistance in getting product replaced.

amazon	Leo Terrell	2010-04-10T02:14:53Z	Everyone goes to the store to search for what they want and when it comes to online shopping it is very convenient. Amazon is a very well-known and great place to go online and shop for certain products. Although, Amazon is literally taking over the world and making businesses and companies out of business it is still the best online shopping place, because service can be extremely fast, there are lots of discounts on products, and the products are just very useful.My family has amazon prime and we can buy products and get them in two days. You even get discounts too, there was a product that my parents were gonna buy for $60, but with amazon prime the price went down to $20. Can you believe it? Although, many businesses and companies are going out of business, Amazon has everything you need at a good price and good shipping. Amazon is a very great place to shop and their products are always in good condition,  hopefully they never run out of business.	N/A, US	1 review	5

amazon	Mick	2010-11-04T13:38:52Z	"Two options: 1) Average prices, lousy service and China slow delivery. 2) Average prices, lousy service, expensive shipping membership, same shipping time that other retailers offer for free.Amazon non-Prime customers receive a lower standard of customer service. Also, Amazon intentionally inconveniences Non-Prime customers by delaying shipping for an unreasonable amount of time in an attempt to manipulate shoppers into buying Prime.Product prices are initially adjusted up to cover shipping, and then they want you to buy Prime in order to receive it in a reasonable amount of time. Prime two day delivery is nothing special, it's not offered on all products and often unreliable. I receive eBay and Walmart orders before Amazon. I placed three separate orders over a period of three days, only one showed ""shipped"" four days after placing the last order. It was the last order I placed that showed and It only shipped because I had attempted to cancel that order. The status just happened to change at the exact time I tried to cancel, so that I couldn't cancel. And, it sat in the warehouse for days after that.  Amazon may be a fair deal for customers who find enough value in the other services offered with Prime membership and shop enough to justify purchasing it. However, it is not a fair marketplace for the infrequent shopping non-Prime customer.Amazon no longer passes along savings to customers. Aside from initial pocketing, the company uses it's profits for huge advertising and massive expansion."	N/A, US	1 review	2

amazon	Leo Terrell	2010-04-10T02:14:53Z	Everyone goes to the store to search for what they want and when it comes to online shopping it is very convenient. Amazon is a very well-known and great place to go online and shop for certain products. Although, Amazon is literally taking over the world and making businesses and companies out of business it is still the best online shopping place, because service can be extremely fast, there are lots of discounts on products, and the products are just very useful.My family has amazon prime and we can buy products and get them in two days. You even get discounts too, there was a product that my parents were gonna buy for $60, but with amazon prime the price went down to $20. Can you believe it? Although, many businesses and companies are going out of business, Amazon has everything you need at a good price and good shipping. Amazon is a very great place to shop and their products are always in good condition,  hopefully they never run out of business.	N/A, US	1 review	5

Also, Amazon intentionally inconveniences Non-Prime customers by delaying shipping for an unreasonable amount of time in an attempt to manipulate shoppers into buying Prime.Product prices are initially adjusted up to cover shipping, and then they want you to buy Prime in order to receive it in a reasonable amount of time. Prime two day delivery is nothing special, it's not offered on all products and often unreliable. I receive eBay and Walmart orders before Amazon. I placed three separate orders over a period of three days, only one showed ""shipped"" four days after placing the last order. It was the last order I placed that showed and It only shipped because I had attempted to cancel that order. The status just happened to change at the exact time I tried to cancel, so that I couldn't cancel. And, it sat in the warehouse for days after that.  Amazon may be a fair deal for customers who find enough value in the other services offered with Prime membership and shop enough to justify purchasing it. However, it is not a fair marketplace for the infrequent shopping non-Prime customer.Amazon no longer passes along savings to customers. Aside from initial pocketing, the company uses it's profits for huge advertising and massive expansion."	N/A, US	1 review	2

At times, the items I ordered gets delivered on time and in perfect condition which I am very grateful of. But other times, my items are either slightly damaged or late.

amazon	Eelasor, Idaho	2010-09-01T19:23:37Z	My experience with making purchases from Amazon has usually been a positive one.  However, in the event that a product I purchase is incorrect and the fault is from a third party seller, Amazon has often provided a refund or told me to keep the item.  There have also been times when experiencing certain issues regarding an item to be purchased, and  they have offered courtesy services such as free shipping or percentages off an item when applicable.For the most part, if someone search for good pricing deals they will find it here, especially for good used books and other good used products as well.

When I went to Amazon all of my personal information including my credit cards were stored on the Amazon.co.uk site.

When I asked them if the companies are separate how come the UK Amazon has all of my personal information? They told me that they share information with all Amazon companies but if there is a problem with an order then the client has to call Amazon in the country where the order was placed?!?

I also live in a an apartment with another family and although we have separate Amazon accounts and Prime accounts, Amazon regularly mixes up our orders and cross utilizes our credit cards??

amazon	Luther Tan	2010-11-03T12:15:51Z	I believe giving them 3 stars is a fair rating. My experiences with Amazon is similar to a love hate relationship. At times, the items I ordered gets delivered on time and in perfect condition which I am very grateful of. But other times, my items are either slightly damaged or late. I had to return them and it will take ages for the item to be sent back before a replacement arrives. Dilemma indeed!	N/A, MY	6 reviews	3

amazon	Eelasor, Idaho	2010-09-01T19:23:37Z	My experience with making purchases from Amazon has usually been a positive one.  However, in the event that a product I purchase is incorrect and the fault is from a third party seller, Amazon has often provided a refund or told me to keep the item.  There have also been times when experiencing certain issues regarding an item to be purchased, and  they have offered courtesy services such as free shipping or percentages off an item when applicable.For the most part, if someone search for good pricing deals they will find it here, especially for good used books and other good used products as well.

When I went to Amazon all of my personal information including my credit cards were stored on the Amazon.co.uk site. When I tried to get a refund for the order that was not delivered they told me i have to call the UK as the companies are separate? When I asked them if the companies are separate how come the UK Amazon has all of my personal information? They told me that they share information with all Amazon companies but if there is a problem with an order then the client has to call Amazon in the country where the order was placed?!? I wonder what the GDPR authorities have to say about such a casual attitude to the GDPR privacy protection law? I also live in a an apartment with another family and although we have separate Amazon accounts and Prime accounts, Amazon regularly mixes up our orders and cross utilizes our credit cards?? I don't think that this is legal and when i complain to them it's ""well it's our policy""??? Terrible arrogant company."	N/A, US	4 reviews	1

amazon	dogtown23	2010-04-17T21:53:20Z	I have happily cut Amazon out of my life entirely.  I do not purchase anything for my business or home from them due to their  awful customer service when I was a paying Prime customer.  The csr's I have spoken to were not helpful and did not attempt to solve the two problems I have ever had to call about.   Both times I have called were about Amazon sold and fulfilled products that were faulty or defective and cost less than $20 each.   They only would say it was my problem and that I should get in touch with the manufacturer and that Amazon would do nothing and would not provide any assistance in getting product replaced.

amazon	Leo Terrell	2010-04-10T02:14:53Z	Everyone goes to the store to search for what they want and when it comes to online shopping it is very convenient. Amazon is a very well-known and great place to go online and shop for certain products. Although, Amazon is literally taking over the world and making businesses and companies out of business it is still the best online shopping place, because service can be extremely fast, there are lots of discounts on products, and the products are just very useful.My family has amazon prime and we can buy products and get them in two days. You even get discounts too, there was a product that my parents were gonna buy for $60, but with amazon prime the price went down to $20. Can you believe it? Although, many businesses and companies are going out of business, Amazon has everything you need at a good price and good shipping. Amazon is a very great place to shop and their products are always in good condition,  hopefully they never run out of business.	N/A, US	1 review	5

amazon	Eelasor, Idaho	2010-09-01T19:23:37Z	My experience with making purchases from Amazon has usually been a positive one.  However, in the event that a product I purchase is incorrect and the fault is from a third party seller, Amazon has often provided a refund or told me to keep the item.  There have also been times when experiencing certain issues regarding an item to be purchased, and  they have offered courtesy services such as free shipping or percentages off an item when applicable.For the most part, if someone search for good pricing deals they will find it here, especially for good used books and other good used products as well.

amazon	anthony genth	2010-07-14T11:19:41Z	"Amazon is too big and completely out of control! I placed an order with Amazon while traveling on business in the UK. When I went to Amazon all of my personal information including my credit cards were stored on the Amazon.co.uk site. When I tried to get a refund for the order that was not delivered they told me i have to call the UK as the companies are separate? When I asked them if the companies are separate how come the UK Amazon has all of my personal information? They told me that they share information with all Amazon companies but if there is a problem with an order then the client has to call Amazon in the country where the order was placed?!? I wonder what the GDPR authorities have to say about such a casual attitude to the GDPR privacy protection law? I also live in a an apartment with another family and although we have separate Amazon accounts and Prime accounts, Amazon regularly mixes up our orders and cross utilizes our credit cards?? I don't think that this is legal and when i complain to them it's ""well it's our policy""??? Terrible arrogant company."	N/A, US	4 reviews	1

amazon	dogtown23	2010-04-17T21:53:20Z	I have happily cut Amazon out of my life entirely.  I do not purchase anything for my business or home from them due to their  awful customer service when I was a paying Prime customer.  The csr's I have spoken to were not helpful and did not attempt to solve the two problems I have ever had to call about.   Both times I have called were about Amazon sold and fulfilled products that were faulty or defective and cost less than $20 each.   They only would say it was my problem and that I should get in touch with the manufacturer and that Amazon would do nothing and would not provide any assistance in getting product replaced.

amazon	Leo Terrell	2010-04-10T02:14:53Z	Everyone goes to the store to search for what they want and when it comes to online shopping it is very convenient. Amazon is a very well-known and great place to go online and shop for certain products. Although, Amazon is literally taking over the world and making businesses and companies out of business it is still the best online shopping place, because service can be extremely fast, there are lots of discounts on products, and the products are just very useful.My family has amazon prime and we can buy products and get them in two days. You even get discounts too, there was a product that my parents were gonna buy for $60, but with amazon prime the price went down to $20. Can you believe it? Although, many businesses and companies are going out of business, Amazon has everything you need at a good price and good shipping. Amazon is a very great place to shop and their products are always in good condition,  hopefully they never run out of business.	N/A, US	1 review	5

amazon	Mick	2010-11-04T13:38:52Z	"Two options: 1) Average prices, lousy service and China slow delivery. 2) Average prices, lousy service, expensive shipping membership, same shipping time that other retailers offer for free.Amazon non-Prime customers receive a lower standard of customer service. Also, Amazon intentionally inconveniences Non-Prime customers by delaying shipping for an unreasonable amount of time in an attempt to manipulate shoppers into buying Prime.Product prices are initially adjusted up to cover shipping, and then they want you to buy Prime in order to receive it in a reasonable amount of time. Prime two day delivery is nothing special, it's not offered on all products and often unreliable. I receive eBay and Walmart orders before Amazon. I placed three separate orders over a period of three days, only one showed ""shipped"" four days after placing the last order. It was the last order I placed that showed and It only shipped because I had attempted to cancel that order. The status just happened to change at the exact time I tried to cancel, so that I couldn't cancel. And, it sat in the warehouse for days after that.  Amazon may be a fair deal for customers who find enough value in the other services offered with Prime membership and shop enough to justify purchasing it. However, it is not a fair marketplace for the infrequent shopping non-Prime customer.Amazon no longer passes along savings to customers. Aside from initial pocketing, the company uses it's profits for huge advertising and massive expansion."	N/A, US	1 review	2

amazon	dogtown23	2010-04-17T21:53:20Z	I have happily cut Amazon out of my life entirely.  I do not purchase anything for my business or home from them due to their  awful customer service when I was a paying Prime customer.  The csr's I have spoken to were not helpful and did not attempt to solve the two problems I have ever had to call about.   Both times I have called were about Amazon sold and fulfilled products that were faulty or defective and cost less than $20 each.   They only would say it was my problem and that I should get in touch with the manufacturer and that Amazon would do nothing and would not provide any assistance in getting product replaced.

amazon	Leo Terrell	2010-04-10T02:14:53Z	Everyone goes to the store to search for what they want and when it comes to online shopping it is very convenient. Amazon is a very well-known and great place to go online and shop for certain products. Although, Amazon is literally taking over the world and making businesses and companies out of business it is still the best online shopping place, because service can be extremely fast, there are lots of discounts on products, and the products are just very useful.My family has amazon prime and we can buy products and get them in two days. You even get discounts too, there was a product that my parents were gonna buy for $60, but with amazon prime the price went down to $20. Can you believe it? Although, many businesses and companies are going out of business, Amazon has everything you need at a good price and good shipping. Amazon is a very great place to shop and their products are always in good condition,  hopefully they never run out of business.	N/A, US	1 review	5

Also, Amazon intentionally inconveniences Non-Prime customers by delaying shipping for an unreasonable amount of time in an attempt to manipulate shoppers into buying Prime.Product prices are initially adjusted up to cover shipping, and then they want you to buy Prime in order to receive it in a reasonable amount of time. Prime two day delivery is nothing special, it's not offered on all products and often unreliable. I receive eBay and Walmart orders before Amazon. I placed three separate orders over a period of three days, only one showed ""shipped"" four days after placing the last order. It was the last order I placed that showed and It only shipped because I had attempted to cancel that order. The status just happened to change at the exact time I tried to cancel, so that I couldn't cancel. And, it sat in the warehouse for days after that.  Amazon may be a fair deal for customers who find enough value in the other services offered with Prime membership and shop enough to justify purchasing it. However, it is not a fair marketplace for the infrequent shopping non-Prime customer.Amazon no longer passes along savings to customers. Aside from initial pocketing, the company uses it's profits for huge advertising and massive expansion."	N/A, US	1 review	2
amazon	Luther Tan	2010-11-03T12:15:51Z	I believe giving them 3 stars is a fair rating. My experiences with Amazon is similar to a love hate relationship. At times, the items I ordered gets delivered on time and in perfect condition which I am very grateful of. But other times, my items are either slightly damaged or late. I had to return them and it will take ages for the item to be sent back before a replacement arrives. Dilemma indeed!	N/A, MY	6 reviews	3

amazon	Eelasor, Idaho	2010-09-01T19:23:37Z	My experience with making purchases from Amazon has usually been a positive one.  However, in the event that a product I purchase is incorrect and the fault is from a third party seller, Amazon has often provided a refund or told me to keep the item.  There have also been times when experiencing certain issues regarding an item to be purchased, and  they have offered courtesy services such as free shipping or percentages off an item when applicable.For the most part, if someone search for good pricing deals they will find it here, especially for good used books and other good used products as well.

When I went to Amazon all of my personal information including my credit cards were stored on the Amazon.co.uk site. When I tried to get a refund for the order that was not delivered they told me i have to call the UK as the companies are separate? When I asked them if the companies are separate how come the UK Amazon has all of my personal information? They told me that they share information with all Amazon companies but if there is a problem with an order then the client has to call Amazon in the country where the order was placed?!? I wonder what the GDPR authorities have to say about such a casual attitude to the GDPR privacy protection law? I also live in a an apartment with another family and although we have separate Amazon accounts and Prime accounts, Amazon regularly mixes up our orders and cross utilizes our credit cards??

Also, Amazon intentionally inconveniences Non-Prime customers by delaying shipping for an unreasonable amount of time in an attempt to manipulate shoppers into buying Prime.Product prices are initially adjusted up to cover shipping, and then they want you to buy Prime in order to receive it in a reasonable amount of time. Prime two day delivery is nothing special, it's not offered on all products and often unreliable. I receive eBay and Walmart orders before Amazon. I placed three separate orders over a period of three days, only one showed ""shipped"" four days after placing the last order. It was the last order I placed that showed and It only shipped because I had attempted to cancel that order. The status just happened to change at the exact time I tried to cancel, so that I couldn't cancel. And, it sat in the warehouse for days after that.  Amazon may be a fair deal for customers who find enough value in the other services offered with Prime membership and shop enough to justify purchasing it. However, it is not a fair marketplace for the infrequent shopping non-Prime customer.Amazon no longer passes along savings to customers. Aside from initial pocketing, the company uses it's profits for huge advertising and massive expansion."	N/A, US	1 review	2
amazon	Luther Tan	2010-11-03T12:15:51Z	I believe giving them 3 stars is a fair rating. My experiences with Amazon is similar to a love hate relationship. At times, the items I ordered gets delivered on time and in perfect condition which I am very grateful of. But other times, my items are either slightly damaged or late. I had to return them and it will take ages for the item to be sent back before a replacement arrives. Dilemma indeed!	N/A, MY	6 reviews	3

amazon	Eelasor, Idaho	2010-09-01T19:23:37Z	My experience with making purchases from Amazon has usually been a positive one.  However, in the event that a product I purchase is incorrect and the fault is from a third party seller, Amazon has often provided a refund or told me to keep the item.  There have also been times when experiencing certain issues regarding an item to be purchased, and  they have offered courtesy services such as free shipping or percentages off an item when applicable.For the most part, if someone search for good pricing deals they will find it here, especially for good used books and other good used products as well.

When I went to Amazon all of my personal information including my credit cards were stored on the Amazon.co.uk site. When I tried to get a refund for the order that was not delivered they told me i have to call the UK as the companies are separate? When I asked them if the companies are separate how come the UK Amazon has all of my personal information? They told me that they share information with all Amazon companies but if there is a problem with an order then the client has to call Amazon in the country where the order was placed?!? I wonder what the GDPR authorities have to say about such a casual attitude to the GDPR privacy protection law? I also live in a an apartment with another family and although we have separate Amazon accounts and Prime accounts, Amazon regularly mixes up our orders and cross utilizes our credit cards?? I don't think that this is legal and when i complain to them it's ""well it's our policy""??? Terrible arrogant company."	N/A, US	4 reviews	1

I do not purchase anything for my business or home from them due to their  awful customer service when I was a paying Prime customer.  The csr's I have spoken to were not helpful and did not attempt to solve the two problems I have ever had to call about.   Both times I have called were about Amazon sold and fulfilled products that were faulty or defective and cost less than $20 each.   They only would say it was my problem and that I should get in touch with the manufacturer and that Amazon would do nothing and would not provide any assistance in getting product replaced.

amazon	Leo Terrell	2010-04-10T02:14:53Z	Everyone goes to the store to search for what they want and when it comes to online shopping it is very convenient. Amazon is a very well-known and great place to go online and shop for certain products. Although, Amazon is literally taking over the world and making businesses and companies out of business it is still the best online shopping place, because service can be extremely fast, there are lots of discounts on products, and the products are just very useful.My family has amazon prime and we can buy products and get them in two days. You even get discounts too, there was a product that my parents were gonna buy for $60, but with amazon prime the price went down to $20. Can you believe it? Although, many businesses and companies are going out of business, Amazon has everything you need at a good price and good shipping. Amazon is a very great place to shop and their products are always in good condition,  hopefully they never run out of business.	N/A, US	1 review	5

amazon	Eelasor, Idaho	2010-09-01T19:23:37Z	My experience with making purchases from Amazon has usually been a positive one.  However, in the event that a product I purchase is incorrect and the fault is from a third party seller, Amazon has often provided a refund or told me to keep the item.  There have also been times when experiencing certain issues regarding an item to be purchased, and  they have offered courtesy services such as free shipping or percentages off an item when applicable.For the most part, if someone search for good pricing deals they will find it here, especially for good used books and other good used products as well.

amazon	anthony genth	2010-07-14T11:19:41Z	"Amazon is too big and completely out of control! I placed an order with Amazon while traveling on business in the UK. When I went to Amazon all of my personal information including my credit cards were stored on the Amazon.co.uk site. When I tried to get a refund for the order that was not delivered they told me i have to call the UK as the companies are separate? When I asked them if the companies are separate how come the UK Amazon has all of my personal information? They told me that they share information with all Amazon companies but if there is a problem with an order then the client has to call Amazon in the country where the order was placed?!? I wonder what the GDPR authorities have to say about such a casual attitude to the GDPR privacy protection law? I also live in a an apartment with another family and although we have separate Amazon accounts and Prime accounts, Amazon regularly mixes up our orders and cross utilizes our credit cards?? I don't think that this is legal and when i complain to them it's ""well it's our policy""??? Terrible arrogant company."	N/A, US	4 reviews	1

amazon	dogtown23	2010-04-17T21:53:20Z	I have happily cut Amazon out of my life entirely.  I do not purchase anything for my business or home from them due to their  awful customer service when I was a paying Prime customer.  The csr's I have spoken to were not helpful and did not attempt to solve the two problems I have ever had to call about.   Both times I have called were about Amazon sold and fulfilled products that were faulty or defective and cost less than $20 each.   They only would say it was my problem and that I should get in touch with the manufacturer and that Amazon would do nothing and would not provide any assistance in getting product replaced.

amazon	Leo Terrell	2010-04-10T02:14:53Z	Everyone goes to the store to search for what they want and when it comes to online shopping it is very convenient. Amazon is a very well-known and great place to go online and shop for certain products. Although, Amazon is literally taking over the world and making businesses and companies out of business it is still the best online shopping place, because service can be extremely fast, there are lots of discounts on products, and the products are just very useful.My family has amazon prime and we can buy products and get them in two days. You even get discounts too, there was a product that my parents were gonna buy for $60, but with amazon prime the price went down to $20. Can you believe it? Although, many businesses and companies are going out of business, Amazon has everything you need at a good price and good shipping. Amazon is a very great place to shop and their products are always in good condition,  hopefully they never run out of business.	N/A, US	1 review	5

Also, Amazon intentionally inconveniences Non-Prime customers by delaying shipping for an unreasonable amount of time in an attempt to manipulate shoppers into buying Prime.Product prices are initially adjusted up to cover shipping, and then they want you to buy Prime in order to receive it in a reasonable amount of time. Prime two day delivery is nothing special, it's not offered on all products and often unreliable. I receive eBay and Walmart orders before Amazon. I placed three separate orders over a period of three days, only one showed ""shipped"" four days after placing the last order. It was the last order I placed that showed and It only shipped because I had attempted to cancel that order. The status just happened to change at the exact time I tried to cancel, so that I couldn't cancel. And, it sat in the warehouse for days after that.  Amazon may be a fair deal for customers who find enough value in the other services offered with Prime membership and shop enough to justify purchasing it. However, it is not a fair marketplace for the infrequent shopping non-Prime customer.Amazon no longer passes along savings to customers. Aside from initial pocketing, the company uses it's profits for huge advertising and massive expansion."	N/A, US	1 review	2

There have also been times when experiencing certain issues regarding an item to be purchased, and  they have offered courtesy services such as free shipping or percentages off an item when applicable.For the most part, if someone search for good pricing deals they will find it here, especially for good used books and other good used products as well.

amazon	anthony genth	2010-07-14T11:19:41Z	"Amazon is too big and completely out of control! I placed an order with Amazon while traveling on business in the UK. When I went to Amazon all of my personal information including my credit cards were stored on the Amazon.co.uk site. When I tried to get a refund for the order that was not delivered they told me i have to call the UK as the companies are separate? When I asked them if the companies are separate how come the UK Amazon has all of my personal information? They told me that they share information with all Amazon companies but if there is a problem with an order then the client has to call Amazon in the country where the order was placed?!? I wonder what the GDPR authorities have to say about such a casual attitude to the GDPR privacy protection law? I also live in a an apartment with another family and although we have separate Amazon accounts and Prime accounts, Amazon regularly mixes up our orders and cross utilizes our credit cards?? I don't think that this is legal and when i complain to them it's ""well it's our policy""??? Terrible arrogant company."	N/A, US	4 reviews	1

amazon	dogtown23	2010-04-17T21:53:20Z	I have happily cut Amazon out of my life entirely.  I do not purchase anything for my business or home from them due to their  awful customer service when I was a paying Prime customer.  The csr's I have spoken to were not helpful and did not attempt to solve the two problems I have ever had to call about.   Both times I have called were about Amazon sold and fulfilled products that were faulty or defective and cost less than $20 each.   They only would say it was my problem and that I should get in touch with the manufacturer and that Amazon would do nothing and would not provide any assistance in getting product replaced.

amazon	Leo Terrell	2010-04-10T02:14:53Z	Everyone goes to the store to search for what they want and when it comes to online shopping it is very convenient. Amazon is a very well-known and great place to go online and shop for certain products. Although, Amazon is literally taking over the world and making businesses and companies out of business it is still the best online shopping place, because service can be extremely fast, there are lots of discounts on products, and the products are just very useful.My family has amazon prime and we can buy products and get them in two days. You even get discounts too, there was a product that my parents were gonna buy for $60, but with amazon prime the price went down to $20. Can you believe it? Although, many businesses and companies are going out of business, Amazon has everything you need at a good price and good shipping. Amazon is a very great place to shop and their products are always in good condition,  hopefully they never run out of business.	N/A, US	1 review	5

amazon	Mick	2010-11-04T13:38:52Z	"Two options: 1) Average prices, lousy service and China slow delivery. 2) Average prices, lousy service, expensive shipping membership, same shipping time that other retailers offer for free.Amazon non-Prime customers receive a lower standard of customer service. Also, Amazon intentionally inconveniences Non-Prime customers by delaying shipping for an unreasonable amount of time in an attempt to manipulate shoppers into buying Prime.Product prices are initially adjusted up to cover shipping, and then they want you to buy Prime in order to receive it in a reasonable amount of time. Prime two day delivery is nothing special, it's not offered on all products and often unreliable. I receive eBay and Walmart orders before Amazon. I placed three separate orders over a period of three days, only one showed ""shipped"" four days after placing the last order. It was the last order I placed that showed and It only shipped because I had attempted to cancel that order. The status just happened to change at the exact time I tried to cancel, so that I couldn't cancel. And, it sat in the warehouse for days after that.  Amazon may be a fair deal for customers who find enough value in the other services offered with Prime membership and shop enough to justify purchasing it. However, it is not a fair marketplace for the infrequent shopping non-Prime customer.Amazon no longer passes along savings to customers. Aside from initial pocketing, the company uses it's profits for huge advertising and massive expansion."	N/A, US	1 review	2

amazon	Leo Terrell	2010-04-10T02:14:53Z	Everyone goes to the store to search for what they want and when it comes to online shopping it is very convenient. Amazon is a very well-known and great place to go online and shop for certain products. Although, Amazon is literally taking over the world and making businesses and companies out of business it is still the best online shopping place, because service can be extremely fast, there are lots of discounts on products, and the products are just very useful.My family has amazon prime and we can buy products and get them in two days. You even get discounts too, there was a product that my parents were gonna buy for $60, but with amazon prime the price went down to $20. Can you believe it? Although, many businesses and companies are going out of business, Amazon has everything you need at a good price and good shipping. Amazon is a very great place to shop and their products are always in good condition,  hopefully they never run out of business.	N/A, US	1 review	5

Also, Amazon intentionally inconveniences Non-Prime customers by delaying shipping for an unreasonable amount of time in an attempt to manipulate shoppers into buying Prime.Product prices are initially adjusted up to cover shipping, and then they want you to buy Prime in order to receive it in a reasonable amount of time. Prime two day delivery is nothing special, it's not offered on all products and often unreliable. I receive eBay and Walmart orders before Amazon. I placed three separate orders over a period of three days, only one showed ""shipped"" four days after placing the last order. It was the last order I placed that showed and It only shipped because I had attempted to cancel that order. The status just happened to change at the exact time I tried to cancel, so that I couldn't cancel. And, it sat in the warehouse for days after that.  Amazon may be a fair deal for customers who find enough value in the other services offered with Prime membership and shop enough to justify purchasing it. However, it is not a fair marketplace for the infrequent shopping non-Prime customer.Amazon no longer passes along savings to customers. Aside from initial pocketing, the company uses it's profits for huge advertising and massive expansion."	N/A, US	1 review	2

At times, the items I ordered gets delivered on time and in perfect condition which I am very grateful of. But other times, my items are either slightly damaged or late.

amazon	Eelasor, Idaho	2010-09-01T19:23:37Z	My experience with making purchases from Amazon has usually been a positive one.  However, in the event that a product I purchase is incorrect and the fault is from a third party seller, Amazon has often provided a refund or told me to keep the item.  There have also been times when experiencing certain issues regarding an item to be purchased, and  they have offered courtesy services such as free shipping or percentages off an item when applicable.For the most part, if someone search for good pricing deals they will find it here, especially for good used books and other good used products as well.

When I went to Amazon all of my personal information including my credit cards were stored on the Amazon.co.uk site.

When I asked them if the companies are separate how come the UK Amazon has all of my personal information? They told me that they share information with all Amazon companies but if there is a problem with an order then the client has to call Amazon in the country where the order was placed?!?

I also live in a an apartment with another family and although we have separate Amazon accounts and Prime accounts, Amazon regularly mixes up our orders and cross utilizes our credit cards??

amazon	Luther Tan	2010-11-03T12:15:51Z	I believe giving them 3 stars is a fair rating. My experiences with Amazon is similar to a love hate relationship. At times, the items I ordered gets delivered on time and in perfect condition which I am very grateful of. But other times, my items are either slightly damaged or late. I had to return them and it will take ages for the item to be sent back before a replacement arrives. Dilemma indeed!	N/A, MY	6 reviews	3

amazon	Eelasor, Idaho	2010-09-01T19:23:37Z	My experience with making purchases from Amazon has usually been a positive one.  However, in the event that a product I purchase is incorrect and the fault is from a third party seller, Amazon has often provided a refund or told me to keep the item.  There have also been times when experiencing certain issues regarding an item to be purchased, and  they have offered courtesy services such as free shipping or percentages off an item when applicable.For the most part, if someone search for good pricing deals they will find it here, especially for good used books and other good used products as well.

When I went to Amazon all of my personal information including my credit cards were stored on the Amazon.co.uk site. When I tried to get a refund for the order that was not delivered they told me i have to call the UK as the companies are separate? When I asked them if the companies are separate how come the UK Amazon has all of my personal information? They told me that they share information with all Amazon companies but if there is a problem with an order then the client has to call Amazon in the country where the order was placed?!? I wonder what the GDPR authorities have to say about such a casual attitude to the GDPR privacy protection law? I also live in a an apartment with another family and although we have separate Amazon accounts and Prime accounts, Amazon regularly mixes up our orders and cross utilizes our credit cards?? I don't think that this is legal and when i complain to them it's ""well it's our policy""??? Terrible arrogant company."	N/A, US	4 reviews	1

amazon	dogtown23	2010-04-17T21:53:20Z	I have happily cut Amazon out of my life entirely.  I do not purchase anything for my business or home from them due to their  awful customer service when I was a paying Prime customer.  The csr's I have spoken to were not helpful and did not attempt to solve the two problems I have ever had to call about.   Both times I have called were about Amazon sold and fulfilled products that were faulty or defective and cost less than $20 each.   They only would say it was my problem and that I should get in touch with the manufacturer and that Amazon would do nothing and would not provide any assistance in getting product replaced.

amazon	Leo Terrell	2010-04-10T02:14:53Z	Everyone goes to the store to search for what they want and when it comes to online shopping it is very convenient. Amazon is a very well-known and great place to go online and shop for certain products. Although, Amazon is literally taking over the world and making businesses and companies out of business it is still the best online shopping place, because service can be extremely fast, there are lots of discounts on products, and the products are just very useful.My family has amazon prime and we can buy products and get them in two days. You even get discounts too, there was a product that my parents were gonna buy for $60, but with amazon prime the price went down to $20. Can you believe it? Although, many businesses and companies are going out of business, Amazon has everything you need at a good price and good shipping. Amazon is a very great place to shop and their products are always in good condition,  hopefully they never run out of business.	N/A, US	1 review	5

amazon	Eelasor, Idaho	2010-09-01T19:23:37Z	My experience with making purchases from Amazon has usually been a positive one.  However, in the event that a product I purchase is incorrect and the fault is from a third party seller, Amazon has often provided a refund or told me to keep the item.  There have also been times when experiencing certain issues regarding an item to be purchased, and  they have offered courtesy services such as free shipping or percentages off an item when applicable.For the most part, if someone search for good pricing deals they will find it here, especially for good used books and other good used products as well.

amazon	anthony genth	2010-07-14T11:19:41Z	"Amazon is too big and completely out of control! I placed an order with Amazon while traveling on business in the UK. When I went to Amazon all of my personal information including my credit cards were stored on the Amazon.co.uk site. When I tried to get a refund for the order that was not delivered they told me i have to call the UK as the companies are separate? When I asked them if the companies are separate how come the UK Amazon has all of my personal information? They told me that they share information with all Amazon companies but if there is a problem with an order then the client has to call Amazon in the country where the order was placed?!? I wonder what the GDPR authorities have to say about such a casual attitude to the GDPR privacy protection law? I also live in a an apartment with another family and although we have separate Amazon accounts and Prime accounts, Amazon regularly mixes up our orders and cross utilizes our credit cards?? I don't think that this is legal and when i complain to them it's ""well it's our policy""??? Terrible arrogant company."	N/A, US	4 reviews	1

amazon	dogtown23	2010-04-17T21:53:20Z	I have happily cut Amazon out of my life entirely.  I do not purchase anything for my business or home from them due to their  awful customer service when I was a paying Prime customer.  The csr's I have spoken to were not helpful and did not attempt to solve the two problems I have ever had to call about.   Both times I have called were about Amazon sold and fulfilled products that were faulty or defective and cost less than $20 each.   They only would say it was my problem and that I should get in touch with the manufacturer and that Amazon would do nothing and would not provide any assistance in getting product replaced.

amazon	Leo Terrell	2010-04-10T02:14:53Z	Everyone goes to the store to search for what they want and when it comes to online shopping it is very convenient. Amazon is a very well-known and great place to go online and shop for certain products. Although, Amazon is literally taking over the world and making businesses and companies out of business it is still the best online shopping place, because service can be extremely fast, there are lots of discounts on products, and the products are just very useful.My family has amazon prime and we can buy products and get them in two days. You even get discounts too, there was a product that my parents were gonna buy for $60, but with amazon prime the price went down to $20. Can you believe it? Although, many businesses and companies are going out of business, Amazon has everything you need at a good price and good shipping. Amazon is a very great place to shop and their products are always in good condition,  hopefully they never run out of business.	N/A, US	1 review	5

amazon	Mick	2010-11-04T13:38:52Z	"Two options: 1) Average prices, lousy service and China slow delivery. 2) Average prices, lousy service, expensive shipping membership, same shipping time that other retailers offer for free.Amazon non-Prime customers receive a lower standard of customer service. Also, Amazon intentionally inconveniences Non-Prime customers by delaying shipping for an unreasonable amount of time in an attempt to manipulate shoppers into buying Prime.Product prices are initially adjusted up to cover shipping, and then they want you to buy Prime in order to receive it in a reasonable amount of time. Prime two day delivery is nothing special, it's not offered on all products and often unreliable. I receive eBay and Walmart orders before Amazon. I placed three separate orders over a period of three days, only one showed ""shipped"" four days after placing the last order. It was the last order I placed that showed and It only shipped because I had attempted to cancel that order. The status just happened to change at the exact time I tried to cancel, so that I couldn't cancel. And, it sat in the warehouse for days after that.  Amazon may be a fair deal for customers who find enough value in the other services offered with Prime membership and shop enough to justify purchasing it. However, it is not a fair marketplace for the infrequent shopping non-Prime customer.Amazon no longer passes along savings to customers. Aside from initial pocketing, the company uses it's profits for huge advertising and massive expansion."	N/A, US	1 review	2

amazon	dogtown23	2010-04-17T21:53:20Z	I have happily cut Amazon out of my life entirely.  I do not purchase anything for my business or home from them due to their  awful customer service when I was a paying Prime customer.  The csr's I have spoken to were not helpful and did not attempt to solve the two problems I have ever had to call about.   Both times I have called were about Amazon sold and fulfilled products that were faulty or defective and cost less than $20 each.   They only would say it was my problem and that I should get in touch with the manufacturer and that Amazon would do nothing and would not provide any assistance in getting product replaced.

amazon	Leo Terrell	2010-04-10T02:14:53Z	Everyone goes to the store to search for what they want and when it comes to online shopping it is very convenient. Amazon is a very well-known and great place to go online and shop for certain products. Although, Amazon is literally taking over the world and making businesses and companies out of business it is still the best online shopping place, because service can be extremely fast, there are lots of discounts on products, and the products are just very useful.My family has amazon prime and we can buy products and get them in two days. You even get discounts too, there was a product that my parents were gonna buy for $60, but with amazon prime the price went down to $20. Can you believe it? Although, many businesses and companies are going out of business, Amazon has everything you need at a good price and good shipping. Amazon is a very great place to shop and their products are always in good condition,  hopefully they never run out of business.	N/A, US	1 review	5

Also, Amazon intentionally inconveniences Non-Prime customers by delaying shipping for an unreasonable amount of time in an attempt to manipulate shoppers into buying Prime.Product prices are initially adjusted up to cover shipping, and then they want you to buy Prime in order to receive it in a reasonable amount of time. Prime two day delivery is nothing special, it's not offered on all products and often unreliable. I receive eBay and Walmart orders before Amazon. I placed three separate orders over a period of three days, only one showed ""shipped"" four days after placing the last order. It was the last order I placed that showed and It only shipped because I had attempted to cancel that order. The status just happened to change at the exact time I tried to cancel, so that I couldn't cancel. And, it sat in the warehouse for days after that.  Amazon may be a fair deal for customers who find enough value in the other services offered with Prime membership and shop enough to justify purchasing it. However, it is not a fair marketplace for the infrequent shopping non-Prime customer.Amazon no longer passes along savings to customers. Aside from initial pocketing, the company uses it's profits for huge advertising and massive expansion."	N/A, US	1 review	2
amazon	Luther Tan	2010-11-03T12:15:51Z	I believe giving them 3 stars is a fair rating. My experiences with Amazon is similar to a love hate relationship. At times, the items I ordered gets delivered on time and in perfect condition which I am very grateful of. But other times, my items are either slightly damaged or late. I had to return them and it will take ages for the item to be sent back before a replacement arrives. Dilemma indeed!	N/A, MY	6 reviews	3

amazon	Eelasor, Idaho	2010-09-01T19:23:37Z	My experience with making purchases from Amazon has usually been a positive one.  However, in the event that a product I purchase is incorrect and the fault is from a third party seller, Amazon has often provided a refund or told me to keep the item.  There have also been times when experiencing certain issues regarding an item to be purchased, and  they have offered courtesy services such as free shipping or percentages off an item when applicable.For the most part, if someone search for good pricing deals they will find it here, especially for good used books and other good used products as well.

When I went to Amazon all of my personal information including my credit cards were stored on the Amazon.co.uk site. When I tried to get a refund for the order that was not delivered they told me i have to call the UK as the companies are separate? When I asked them if the companies are separate how come the UK Amazon has all of my personal information? They told me that they share information with all Amazon companies but if there is a problem with an order then the client has to call Amazon in the country where the order was placed?!? I wonder what the GDPR authorities have to say about such a casual attitude to the GDPR privacy protection law? I also live in a an apartment with another family and although we have separate Amazon accounts and Prime accounts, Amazon regularly mixes up our orders and cross utilizes our credit cards??

Also, Amazon intentionally inconveniences Non-Prime customers by delaying shipping for an unreasonable amount of time in an attempt to manipulate shoppers into buying Prime.Product prices are initially adjusted up to cover shipping, and then they want you to buy Prime in order to receive it in a reasonable amount of time. Prime two day delivery is nothing special, it's not offered on all products and often unreliable. I receive eBay and Walmart orders before Amazon. I placed three separate orders over a period of three days, only one showed ""shipped"" four days after placing the last order. It was the last order I placed that showed and It only shipped because I had attempted to cancel that order. The status just happened to change at the exact time I tried to cancel, so that I couldn't cancel. And, it sat in the warehouse for days after that.  Amazon may be a fair deal for customers who find enough value in the other services offered with Prime membership and shop enough to justify purchasing it. However, it is not a fair marketplace for the infrequent shopping non-Prime customer.Amazon no longer passes along savings to customers. Aside from initial pocketing, the company uses it's profits for huge advertising and massive expansion."	N/A, US	1 review	2
amazon	Luther Tan	2010-11-03T12:15:51Z	I believe giving them 3 stars is a fair rating. My experiences with Amazon is similar to a love hate relationship. At times, the items I ordered gets delivered on time and in perfect condition which I am very grateful of. But other times, my items are either slightly damaged or late. I had to return them and it will take ages for the item to be sent back before a replacement arrives. Dilemma indeed!	N/A, MY	6 reviews	3

amazon	Eelasor, Idaho	2010-09-01T19:23:37Z	My experience with making purchases from Amazon has usually been a positive one.  However, in the event that a product I purchase is incorrect and the fault is from a third party seller, Amazon has often provided a refund or told me to keep the item.  There have also been times when experiencing certain issues regarding an item to be purchased, and  they have offered courtesy services such as free shipping or percentages off an item when applicable.For the most part, if someone search for good pricing deals they will find it here, especially for good used books and other good used products as well.

When I went to Amazon all of my personal information including my credit cards were stored on the Amazon.co.uk site. When I tried to get a refund for the order that was not delivered they told me i have to call the UK as the companies are separate? When I asked them if the companies are separate how come the UK Amazon has all of my personal information? They told me that they share information with all Amazon companies but if there is a problem with an order then the client has to call Amazon in the country where the order was placed?!? I wonder what the GDPR authorities have to say about such a casual attitude to the GDPR privacy protection law? I also live in a an apartment with another family and although we have separate Amazon accounts and Prime accounts, Amazon regularly mixes up our orders and cross utilizes our credit cards?? I don't think that this is legal and when i complain to them it's ""well it's our policy""??? Terrible arrogant company."	N/A, US	4 reviews	1

I do not purchase anything for my business or home from them due to their  awful customer service when I was a paying Prime customer.  The csr's I have spoken to were not helpful and did not attempt to solve the two problems I have ever had to call about.   Both times I have called were about Amazon sold and fulfilled products that were faulty or defective and cost less than $20 each.   They only would say it was my problem and that I should get in touch with the manufacturer and that Amazon would do nothing and would not provide any assistance in getting product replaced.

amazon	Leo Terrell	2010-04-10T02:14:53Z	Everyone goes to the store to search for what they want and when it comes to online shopping it is very convenient. Amazon is a very well-known and great place to go online and shop for certain products. Although, Amazon is literally taking over the world and making businesses and companies out of business it is still the best online shopping place, because service can be extremely fast, there are lots of discounts on products, and the products are just very useful.My family has amazon prime and we can buy products and get them in two days. You even get discounts too, there was a product that my parents were gonna buy for $60, but with amazon prime the price went down to $20. Can you believe it? Although, many businesses and companies are going out of business, Amazon has everything you need at a good price and good shipping. Amazon is a very great place to shop and their products are always in good condition,  hopefully they never run out of business.	N/A, US	1 review	5

amazon	Eelasor, Idaho	2010-09-01T19:23:37Z	My experience with making purchases from Amazon has usually been a positive one.  However, in the event that a product I purchase is incorrect and the fault is from a third party seller, Amazon has often provided a refund or told me to keep the item.  There have also been times when experiencing certain issues regarding an item to be purchased, and  they have offered courtesy services such as free shipping or percentages off an item when applicable.For the most part, if someone search for good pricing deals they will find it here, especially for good used books and other good used products as well.

amazon	anthony genth	2010-07-14T11:19:41Z	"Amazon is too big and completely out of control! I placed an order with Amazon while traveling on business in the UK. When I went to Amazon all of my personal information including my credit cards were stored on the Amazon.co.uk site. When I tried to get a refund for the order that was not delivered they told me i have to call the UK as the companies are separate? When I asked them if the companies are separate how come the UK Amazon has all of my personal information? They told me that they share information with all Amazon companies but if there is a problem with an order then the client has to call Amazon in the country where the order was placed?!? I wonder what the GDPR authorities have to say about such a casual attitude to the GDPR privacy protection law? I also live in a an apartment with another family and although we have separate Amazon accounts and Prime accounts, Amazon regularly mixes up our orders and cross utilizes our credit cards?? I don't think that this is legal and when i complain to them it's ""well it's our policy""??? Terrible arrogant company."	N/A, US	4 reviews	1

amazon	dogtown23	2010-04-17T21:53:20Z	I have happily cut Amazon out of my life entirely.  I do not purchase anything for my business or home from them due to their  awful customer service when I was a paying Prime customer.  The csr's I have spoken to were not helpful and did not attempt to solve the two problems I have ever had to call about.   Both times I have called were about Amazon sold and fulfilled products that were faulty or defective and cost less than $20 each.   They only would say it was my problem and that I should get in touch with the manufacturer and that Amazon would do nothing and would not provide any assistance in getting product replaced.

amazon	Leo Terrell	2010-04-10T02:14:53Z	Everyone goes to the store to search for what they want and when it comes to online shopping it is very convenient. Amazon is a very well-known and great place to go online and shop for certain products. Although, Amazon is literally taking over the world and making businesses and companies out of business it is still the best online shopping place, because service can be extremely fast, there are lots of discounts on products, and the products are just very useful.My family has amazon prime and we can buy products and get them in two days. You even get discounts too, there was a product that my parents were gonna buy for $60, but with amazon prime the price went down to $20. Can you believe it? Although, many businesses and companies are going out of business, Amazon has everything you need at a good price and good shipping. Amazon is a very great place to shop and their products are always in good condition,  hopefully they never run out of business.	N/A, US	1 review	5

Also, Amazon intentionally inconveniences Non-Prime customers by delaying shipping for an unreasonable amount of time in an attempt to manipulate shoppers into buying Prime.Product prices are initially adjusted up to cover shipping, and then they want you to buy Prime in order to receive it in a reasonable amount of time. Prime two day delivery is nothing special, it's not offered on all products and often unreliable. I receive eBay and Walmart orders before Amazon. I placed three separate orders over a period of three days, only one showed ""shipped"" four days after placing the last order. It was the last order I placed that showed and It only shipped because I had attempted to cancel that order. The status just happened to change at the exact time I tried to cancel, so that I couldn't cancel. And, it sat in the warehouse for days after that.  Amazon may be a fair deal for customers who find enough value in the other services offered with Prime membership and shop enough to justify purchasing it. However, it is not a fair marketplace for the infrequent shopping non-Prime customer.Amazon no longer passes along savings to customers. Aside from initial pocketing, the company uses it's profits for huge advertising and massive expansion."	N/A, US	1 review	2

There have also been times when experiencing certain issues regarding an item to be purchased, and  they have offered courtesy services such as free shipping or percentages off an item when applicable.For the most part, if someone search for good pricing deals they will find it here, especially for good used books and other good used products as well.

amazon	anthony genth	2010-07-14T11:19:41Z	"Amazon is too big and completely out of control! I placed an order with Amazon while traveling on business in the UK. When I went to Amazon all of my personal information including my credit cards were stored on the Amazon.co.uk site. When I tried to get a refund for the order that was not delivered they told me i have to call the UK as the companies are separate? When I asked them if the companies are separate how come the UK Amazon has all of my personal information? They told me that they share information with all Amazon companies but if there is a problem with an order then the client has to call Amazon in the country where the order was placed?!? I wonder what the GDPR authorities have to say about such a casual attitude to the GDPR privacy protection law? I also live in a an apartment with another family and although we have separate Amazon accounts and Prime accounts, Amazon regularly mixes up our orders and cross utilizes our credit cards?? I don't think that this is legal and when i complain to them it's ""well it's our policy""??? Terrible arrogant company."	N/A, US	4 reviews	1

amazon	dogtown23	2010-04-17T21:53:20Z	I have happily cut Amazon out of my life entirely.  I do not purchase anything for my business or home from them due to their  awful customer service when I was a paying Prime customer.  The csr's I have spoken to were not helpful and did not attempt to solve the two problems I have ever had to call about.   Both times I have called were about Amazon sold and fulfilled products that were faulty or defective and cost less than $20 each.   They only would say it was my problem and that I should get in touch with the manufacturer and that Amazon would do nothing and would not provide any assistance in getting product replaced.

amazon	Leo Terrell	2010-04-10T02:14:53Z	Everyone goes to the store to search for what they want and when it comes to online shopping it is very convenient. Amazon is a very well-known and great place to go online and shop for certain products. Although, Amazon is literally taking over the world and making businesses and companies out of business it is still the best online shopping place, because service can be extremely fast, there are lots of discounts on products, and the products are just very useful.My family has amazon prime and we can buy products and get them in two days. You even get discounts too, there was a product that my parents were gonna buy for $60, but with amazon prime the price went down to $20. Can you believe it? Although, many businesses and companies are going out of business, Amazon has everything you need at a good price and good shipping. Amazon is a very great place to shop and their products are always in good condition,  hopefully they never run out of business.	N/A, US	1 review	5

amazon	Mick	2010-11-04T13:38:52Z	"Two options: 1) Average prices, lousy service and China slow delivery. 2) Average prices, lousy service, expensive shipping membership, same shipping time that other retailers offer for free.Amazon non-Prime customers receive a lower standard of customer service. Also, Amazon intentionally inconveniences Non-Prime customers by delaying shipping for an unreasonable amount of time in an attempt to manipulate shoppers into buying Prime.Product prices are initially adjusted up to cover shipping, and then they want you to buy Prime in order to receive it in a reasonable amount of time. Prime two day delivery is nothing special, it's not offered on all products and often unreliable. I receive eBay and Walmart orders before Amazon. I placed three separate orders over a period of three days, only one showed ""shipped"" four days after placing the last order. It was the last order I placed that showed and It only shipped because I had attempted to cancel that order. The status just happened to change at the exact time I tried to cancel, so that I couldn't cancel. And, it sat in the warehouse for days after that.  Amazon may be a fair deal for customers who find enough value in the other services offered with Prime membership and shop enough to justify purchasing it. However, it is not a fair marketplace for the infrequent shopping non-Prime customer.Amazon no longer passes along savings to customers. Aside from initial pocketing, the company uses it's profits for huge advertising and massive expansion."	N/A, US	1 review	2

amazon	Leo Terrell	2010-04-10T02:14:53Z	Everyone goes to the store to search for what they want and when it comes to online shopping it is very convenient. Amazon is a very well-known and great place to go online and shop for certain products. Although, Amazon is literally taking over the world and making businesses and companies out of business it is still the best online shopping place, because service can be extremely fast, there are lots of discounts on products, and the products are just very useful.My family has amazon prime and we can buy products and get them in two days. You even get discounts too, there was a product that my parents were gonna buy for $60, but with amazon prime the price went down to $20. Can you believe it? Although, many businesses and companies are going out of business, Amazon has everything you need at a good price and good shipping. Amazon is a very great place to shop and their products are always in good condition,  hopefully they never run out of business.	N/A, US	1 review	5

Also, Amazon intentionally inconveniences Non-Prime customers by delaying shipping for an unreasonable amount of time in an attempt to manipulate shoppers into buying Prime.Product prices are initially adjusted up to cover shipping, and then they want you to buy Prime in order to receive it in a reasonable amount of time. Prime two day delivery is nothing special, it's not offered on all products and often unreliable. I receive eBay and Walmart orders before Amazon. I placed three separate orders over a period of three days, only one showed ""shipped"" four days after placing the last order. It was the last order I placed that showed and It only shipped because I had attempted to cancel that order. The status just happened to change at the exact time I tried to cancel, so that I couldn't cancel. And, it sat in the warehouse for days after that.  Amazon may be a fair deal for customers who find enough value in the other services offered with Prime membership and shop enough to justify purchasing it. However, it is not a fair marketplace for the infrequent shopping non-Prime customer.Amazon no longer passes along savings to customers. Aside from initial pocketing, the company uses it's profits for huge advertising and massive expansion."	N/A, US	1 review	2

At times, the items I ordered gets delivered on time and in perfect condition which I am very grateful of. But other times, my items are either slightly damaged or late.

amazon	Eelasor, Idaho	2010-09-01T19:23:37Z	My experience with making purchases from Amazon has usually been a positive one.  However, in the event that a product I purchase is incorrect and the fault is from a third party seller, Amazon has often provided a refund or told me to keep the item.  There have also been times when experiencing certain issues regarding an item to be purchased, and  they have offered courtesy services such as free shipping or percentages off an item when applicable.For the most part, if someone search for good pricing deals they will find it here, especially for good used books and other good used products as well.

When I went to Amazon all of my personal information including my credit cards were stored on the Amazon.co.uk site.

When I asked them if the companies are separate how come the UK Amazon has all of my personal information? They told me that they share information with all Amazon companies but if there is a problem with an order then the client has to call Amazon in the country where the order was placed?!?

I also live in a an apartment with another family and although we have separate Amazon accounts and Prime accounts, Amazon regularly mixes up our orders and cross utilizes our credit cards??

amazon	Luther Tan	2010-11-03T12:15:51Z	I believe giving them 3 stars is a fair rating. My experiences with Amazon is similar to a love hate relationship. At times, the items I ordered gets delivered on time and in perfect condition which I am very grateful of. But other times, my items are either slightly damaged or late. I had to return them and it will take ages for the item to be sent back before a replacement arrives. Dilemma indeed!	N/A, MY	6 reviews	3

amazon	Eelasor, Idaho	2010-09-01T19:23:37Z	My experience with making purchases from Amazon has usually been a positive one.  However, in the event that a product I purchase is incorrect and the fault is from a third party seller, Amazon has often provided a refund or told me to keep the item.  There have also been times when experiencing certain issues regarding an item to be purchased, and  they have offered courtesy services such as free shipping or percentages off an item when applicable.For the most part, if someone search for good pricing deals they will find it here, especially for good used books and other good used products as well.

When I went to Amazon all of my personal information including my credit cards were stored on the Amazon.co.uk site. When I tried to get a refund for the order that was not delivered they told me i have to call the UK as the companies are separate? When I asked them if the companies are separate how come the UK Amazon has all of my personal information? They told me that they share information with all Amazon companies but if there is a problem with an order then the client has to call Amazon in the country where the order was placed?!? I wonder what the GDPR authorities have to say about such a casual attitude to the GDPR privacy protection law? I also live in a an apartment with another family and although we have separate Amazon accounts and Prime accounts, Amazon regularly mixes up our orders and cross utilizes our credit cards?? I don't think that this is legal and when i complain to them it's ""well it's our policy""??? Terrible arrogant company."	N/A, US	4 reviews	1

amazon	dogtown23	2010-04-17T21:53:20Z	I have happily cut Amazon out of my life entirely.  I do not purchase anything for my business or home from them due to their  awful customer service when I was a paying Prime customer.  The csr's I have spoken to were not helpful and did not attempt to solve the two problems I have ever had to call about.   Both times I have called were about Amazon sold and fulfilled products that were faulty or defective and cost less than $20 each.   They only would say it was my problem and that I should get in touch with the manufacturer and that Amazon would do nothing and would not provide any assistance in getting product replaced.

amazon	Leo Terrell	2010-04-10T02:14:53Z	Everyone goes to the store to search for what they want and when it comes to online shopping it is very convenient. Amazon is a very well-known and great place to go online and shop for certain products. Although, Amazon is literally taking over the world and making businesses and companies out of business it is still the best online shopping place, because service can be extremely fast, there are lots of discounts on products, and the products are just very useful.My family has amazon prime and we can buy products and get them in two days. You even get discounts too, there was a product that my parents were gonna buy for $60, but with amazon prime the price went down to $20. Can you believe it? Although, many businesses and companies are going out of business, Amazon has everything you need at a good price and good shipping. Amazon is a very great place to shop and their products are always in good condition,  hopefully they never run out of business.	N/A, US	1 review	5

amazon	Eelasor, Idaho	2010-09-01T19:23:37Z	My experience with making purchases from Amazon has usually been a positive one.  However, in the event that a product I purchase is incorrect and the fault is from a third party seller, Amazon has often provided a refund or told me to keep the item.  There have also been times when experiencing certain issues regarding an item to be purchased, and  they have offered courtesy services such as free shipping or percentages off an item when applicable.For the most part, if someone search for good pricing deals they will find it here, especially for good used books and other good used products as well.

amazon	anthony genth	2010-07-14T11:19:41Z	"Amazon is too big and completely out of control! I placed an order with Amazon while traveling on business in the UK. When I went to Amazon all of my personal information including my credit cards were stored on the Amazon.co.uk site. When I tried to get a refund for the order that was not delivered they told me i have to call the UK as the companies are separate? When I asked them if the companies are separate how come the UK Amazon has all of my personal information? They told me that they share information with all Amazon companies but if there is a problem with an order then the client has to call Amazon in the country where the order was placed?!? I wonder what the GDPR authorities have to say about such a casual attitude to the GDPR privacy protection law? I also live in a an apartment with another family and although we have separate Amazon accounts and Prime accounts, Amazon regularly mixes up our orders and cross utilizes our credit cards?? I don't think that this is legal and when i complain to them it's ""well it's our policy""??? Terrible arrogant company."	N/A, US	4 reviews	1

amazon	dogtown23	2010-04-17T21:53:20Z	I have happily cut Amazon out of my life entirely.  I do not purchase anything for my business or home from them due to their  awful customer service when I was a paying Prime customer.  The csr's I have spoken to were not helpful and did not attempt to solve the two problems I have ever had to call about.   Both times I have called were about Amazon sold and fulfilled products that were faulty or defective and cost less than $20 each.   They only would say it was my problem and that I should get in touch with the manufacturer and that Amazon would do nothing and would not provide any assistance in getting product replaced.

amazon	Leo Terrell	2010-04-10T02:14:53Z	Everyone goes to the store to search for what they want and when it comes to online shopping it is very convenient. Amazon is a very well-known and great place to go online and shop for certain products. Although, Amazon is literally taking over the world and making businesses and companies out of business it is still the best online shopping place, because service can be extremely fast, there are lots of discounts on products, and the products are just very useful.My family has amazon prime and we can buy products and get them in two days. You even get discounts too, there was a product that my parents were gonna buy for $60, but with amazon prime the price went down to $20. Can you believe it? Although, many businesses and companies are going out of business, Amazon has everything you need at a good price and good shipping. Amazon is a very great place to shop and their products are always in good condition,  hopefully they never run out of business.	N/A, US	1 review	5

amazon	Mick	2010-11-04T13:38:52Z	"Two options: 1) Average prices, lousy service and China slow delivery. 2) Average prices, lousy service, expensive shipping membership, same shipping time that other retailers offer for free.Amazon non-Prime customers receive a lower standard of customer service. Also, Amazon intentionally inconveniences Non-Prime customers by delaying shipping for an unreasonable amount of time in an attempt to manipulate shoppers into buying Prime.Product prices are initially adjusted up to cover shipping, and then they want you to buy Prime in order to receive it in a reasonable amount of time. Prime two day delivery is nothing special, it's not offered on all products and often unreliable. I receive eBay and Walmart orders before Amazon. I placed three separate orders over a period of three days, only one showed ""shipped"" four days after placing the last order. It was the last order I placed that showed and It only shipped because I had attempted to cancel that order. The status just happened to change at the exact time I tried to cancel, so that I couldn't cancel. And, it sat in the warehouse for days after that.  Amazon may be a fair deal for customers who find enough value in the other services offered with Prime membership and shop enough to justify purchasing it. However, it is not a fair marketplace for the infrequent shopping non-Prime customer.Amazon no longer passes along savings to customers. Aside from initial pocketing, the company uses it's profits for huge advertising and massive expansion."	N/A, US	1 review	2
amazon	Luther Tan	2010-11-03T12:15:51Z	I believe giving them 3 stars is a fair rating. My experiences with Amazon is similar to a love hate relationship. At times, the items I ordered gets delivered on time and in perfect condition which I am very grateful of. But other times, my items are either slightly damaged or late. I had to return them and it will take ages for the item to be sent back before a replacement arrives. Dilemma indeed!	N/A, MY	6 reviews	3
amazon	BlingIt OnHome	2010-10-27T16:55:03Z	"purchased an item from amazon.com - when item came it was NOT as advertised - it stated ""electrical"" and the picture clearly shows an extention lead/cable on their listing - NO cable and even worse a usa male pin coming out of the handle with NO lead so absolutely useless in the uk - can't even purchase a lead anywhere on amazon.  phoned them up to ask for prepaid returns label and after speaking to the same woman 3 times (who pretended she was in a different department being transferred) put me on hold for an hour intermittently coming back to say ""sorry"".  item was not as described and totally misleading in pictures and wording - postage back to amazon.com will be a minimum of Â£70.00 and they will NOT send me a prepaid returns label - i told them if i had changed my mind or didn't want it then i would pay returns but as it was a 100% total FALSE listing in pictures and wording then they should pay for it - they will not - even ebay haters have to LOVE ebay as they always send a returns label regardless!  amazon is a joke and i shall never purchase from them again - disgusting!"	lincolnshire, GB	6 reviews	1
amazon	Terry	2010-10-26T12:33:55Z	I got some specialty playing cards before I got them the description  said new. When they came in the mail they were used there was spots on them and the box was in bad shape. I also ordered something another time and it never came. Only thing you're good they for is watching a Prime movie. Buyers beware don't buy nothing from them online.	N/A, US	3 reviews	2
